Which of the following rules of engagement provides the days and times that the penetration test can occur?

- 

  Location of team

- 

  Timeline

- 

  Test boundaries

- 

  Temporal restrictions

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: Temporal restrictions provide the constraints for which days and times the penetration test can be performed. For example, some rules of engagement will prevent the engagement from occurring outside of normal working hours. Conversely, others only allow the engagement to occur during working hours. This is something that should be clearly documented in the scope of work and the scoping documents. The test boundaries are used to define the acceptable actions and scope used during an engagement. The timeline of an engagement provides a clear enumeration of the tasks to be performed as part of the penetration test. The location of the team defines whether the penetration testers will conduct a remote or on-site assessment.

- 

  Mimikatz

  (正確)

- 

  Hydra

- 

  w3af

- 

  Gobuster

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Mimikatz is a tool that gathers credentials by extracting key elements from memory such as cleartext passwords, hashes, and PIN codes. Gobuster is a tool that can discover subdomains, directories, and files by brute-forcing from a list of common names. The Web Application Attack and Audit Framework (w3af) allows you to identify and exploit a large set of web-based vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Hydra is a password cracking tool that supports parallel testing of several network authentication types simultaneously.

Based on your review, what does this scan indicate?

- 

  173.12.15.23 might be infected and beaconing to a C2 server

- 

  This appears to be normal network traffic

  (正確)

- 

  173.12.15.23 might be infected with malware

- 

  192.168.3.145 might be infected and beaconing to a C2 server

- 

  192.168.3.145 might be infected with malware

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: This appears to be normal network traffic. The first line shows that a DNS lookup was performed for a website (test.diontraining.com). The second line shows the response from the DNS server with the IP address of the website. The third line begins a three-way handshake between an internal host and the website. The fourth line is the SYN-ACK response from the website to the internal host as part of this handshake. The fifth line is a standard Windows NetBIOS query within the local area network to translate human-readable names to local IP addresses. The sixth and seventh lines appear to be inbound requests to port 443 and port 8080, both of which were sent the RST by the internal host's firewall since it is not running those services on the host. None of this network traffic appears to be suspicious.

You are conducting a password audit. Which of these options is the least complex password?

- 

  5VwEz35b

- 

  ujepmnxf

  (正確)

- 

  tYSeNDnV

- 

  4@kn?Q9$

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: The least complex password of these four options is ujepmnxf. All four passwords are eight characters, so the least complex password will be the one that uses the smallest character set. As shown in the password 4@kn?Q9$, there are four character types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The least complex password only uses one of these character types. Therefore, the password ujepmnxf is the least complex and least secure password since it only includes lowercase letters.

You are working as a network administrator for Dion Training. The company has decided to allow employees to connect their devices to the corporate wireless network under a new BYOD policy. You have been asked to separate the corporate network into an administrative network (for corporate-owned devices) and an untrusted network (for employee-owned devices). Which of the following technologies should you implement to achieve this goal?

- 

  WPA2

- 

  VLAN

  (正確)

- 

  VPN

- 

  MAC filtering

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: A virtual local area network (VLAN) is a type of network segmentation configured in your network switches that prevent communications between different VLANs without using a router. This allows two virtually separated networks to exist on one physical network and separates the two virtual network's data. A virtual private network (VPN) is a remote access capability to connect a trusted device over an untrusted network back to the corporate network. A VPN would not create the desired effect. WPA2 is a type of wireless encryption, but it will not create two different segmented networks on the same physical hardware. MAC filtering is used to allow or deny a device from connecting to a network, but it will not create two network segments, as desired.

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: A business email compromise (BEC) is a form of elicitation where the attacker impersonates a high-level executive or directly takes over their email account. The attacker then sends an email to elicit personnel to take action on their behalf. In this example, the attacker is impersonating the company's CEO by sending an email to the financial personnel requesting they send a money transfer for what appears to be a legitimate service. This example also uses the urgency and authority motivation factors to convince the employee to take action.

  support@diontraining.com

  (正確)

- 

  jason.dion@diontraining.com

- 

  jason_dion@dion.training

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: In the above REGEX, the \b parameter identifies that we are looking for whole words. The strategic use of the + operator indicates the three places where the word is broken into parts. The first part ([A-Za-z0-9_%+-]" is composed of upper or lower case alphanumeric symbols "_%+-." After the first part of the word and the at sign (@) is specified, follows by another word ([A-Za-z0-9.-]), a period (\.), and another purely alphabetic (non-numeric) string that is 2-6 characters in length. This finds a standard email format of something@something.com (but could be @something.co, @something.org, @something.money, or other options as long as the top-level domain is between 2 and 6 characters). The option of www.diontraining.com is wrong because it does not have an @ sign in the string. The option of jason.dion@diontraining.com is wrong because you cannot use a period before the @ symbol, only letters, numbers, and some specified symbols ( _ % + - ). The option of jason_dion@dion.training is wrong because the last word (training) is longer than 6 characters in length. As a cybersecurity analyst, you must get comfortable creating regular expressions and understanding what type of output they generate.

Why must you have an established communication path and a client's emergency point of contact during a penetration test?

- 

  To report a list of cracked passwords

- 

  To receive written authorization

- 

  To report critical findings

  (正確)

- 

  To change the scope of work

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.3: If an indicator of a previous compromise is found during a penetration test, the team should immediately inform the client's emergency point of contact unless the scope of work states otherwise. The penetration testing team should have a direct communication path with the system owners or their trusted agents during an engagement. If the team discovers any security breaches, current hacking activity, extremely critical findings on a production server, or a production server becomes unresponsive during exploitation, then the team should stop what they are doing and contract their trusted point of contact within the organization to get further guidance. The trusted agents and communication paths should be determined when planning the engagement.

Susan, a help desk technician at Dion Training, has received several trouble tickets today related to employees receiving the same email as part of a phishing campaign. She has determined that the email's malicious link is not being blocked by the company's security suite when a user clicks the link. Susan asks you what action can be performed to prevent a user from reaching the website associated with the phishing email's malicious link. What action do you recommend she utilize?

- 

  Forward this phishing email to all employees with a warning not to click on the embedded links

- 

  Block the IP address of the malicious domain in your firewall's ACL

- 

  Enable TLS on your organization's mail server

- 

  Add the malicious domain name to your content filter and web proxy's block list

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: To prevent a user from accessing the malicious website when the link is clicked, the malicious domain name should be added to the blocklist of the company's content filter and web proxy. This will ensure that no devices on the network can reach the malicious domain name. While blocking the IP address associated with the domain name might help for a short period of time, the malicious domain's owner could quickly redirect the DNS to point to a different IP. Then the users would still be able to access the malicious domain and its contents. Enabling TLS on the mail server will only encrypt the connection between the email server and its clients. Still, it will not prevent the users from clicking on the malicious link and accessing the malicious content. While informing the users that there is an active attempt at phishing being conducted against the organization is a good idea, forwarding the phishing email with the malicious link will generally cause more users to accidentally click on the malicious link, which further exacerbates the issue.

A project lead reviews the statement of work for an upcoming project that is focused on identifying potential weaknesses in the organization’s internal and external network infrastructure. As part of the project, a team of external contractors will attempt to employ various attacks against the organization. The work statement specifically addresses the utilization of an automated tool to probe network resources in an attempt to develop logical diagrams indicating weaknesses in the infrastructure. Based on this scope of work, what type of activity is to be performed?

- 

  Session hijacking

- 

  Penetration testing

  (正確)

- 

  Social engineering

- 

  Vulnerability scanning

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.3: Penetration testing is the act of using a computer system, an individual network, or another application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could use to compromise your systems. Penetration testing can also find endpoints with vulnerabilities, which makes the attack surface greater. Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of the potential points of exploit on a computer or network to identify security holes. A vulnerability scan detects and classifies system weaknesses in computers, networks, and communications equipment and predicts the effectiveness of countermeasures. Penetration tests are usually conducted from outside the network and may contain vulnerability scanning, as well. Vulnerability scanning is normally conducted from within the network by an organization's system administrators and security teams. Social engineering is the act of exploiting human weaknesses to gain access to personal information and protected systems. Social engineering may be part of a penetration test, as well, but it would not use an automated tool to probe network resources. Session hijacking is a method of taking over a web user session by surreptitiously obtaining the session ID and masquerading as the authorized user.

Jeff has been contacted by an external security company and told that they had found a copy of his company's proprietary source code on GitHub. Upon further investigation, Jeff has determined that his organization owns the repository where the source code is located. Which of the following mitigations should Jeff apply immediately?

- 

  Delete the repository

- 

  Investigate if the source code was downloaded

- 

  Change the repository from public to private

  (正確)

- 

  Revaluate the organization's information management policies

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.4: Jeff should immediately change the repository from public to private to prevent further exposure of the source code. Deleting the repository would also fix the issue but could compromise the company's ongoing business operations. Reevaluation of the company's information management policies should be done, but this is not as time-critical as changing the repository's public/private setting. Once the repository is configured to be private, then Jeff should investigate any possible compromises that may have occurred and reevaluate their policies.

Jay is replacing his organization's current vulnerability scanner with a new tool. As he begins to create the scanner's configurations and scanning policy, he notices a conflict in the settings recommended between different documents. Which of the following sources must Jay follow when trying to resolve these conflicts?

- 

  Configuration settings from the prior system

- 

  NIST guideline documents

- 

  Vendor best practices

- 

  Corporate policy

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Policies are formalized statements that apply to a specific area or task. Policies are mandatory, and employees who violate a policy may be disciplined. Guidelines are general, non-mandatory recommendations. Best practices are considered procedures that are accepted as being correct or most effective but are not mandatory to be followed. Configuration settings from the prior system could be helpful, but this is not a mandatory compliance area like a policy. Therefore, Jay should first follow the policy before the other three options if there is a conflict.

The physical security manager has asked you to assist with the risk assessment of some proposed new security measures. The manager is concerned that during a power outage, the server room might be targeted for attack. Luckily, they have many different protection measures in place to keep intruders out of the server room. During a power outage, which of the following security controls would still be usable?

- 

  Biometric scanners

- 

  Motion detectors

- 

  Door locks

  (正確)

- 

  Video surveillance

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: A traditional door lock doesn't require power to operate. Therefore, it will still protect the facility and keep the intruder out of the server room. The other options all require power to function and operate. A biometric lock is any lock that can be activated by biometric features, such as a fingerprint, voiceprint, or retina scan. Biometric locks make it more difficult for someone to counterfeit the key used to open the lock or a user’s account. A smart card is a form of hardware token. Closed-circuit television is a type of video surveillance where video cameras transmit a signal to a specific place using a limited set of monitors. A motion detector is an electrical device that utilizes a sensor to detect nearby motion. Such a device is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area. They form a vital component of security, automated lighting control, home control, energy efficiency, and other useful systems.

A vulnerability scanner has reported that a vulnerability exists in the system. Upon validating the report, the analyst determines that this reported vulnerability does not exist on the system. What is the proper term for this situation?

- 

  True positive

- 

  False negative

- 

  False positive

  (正確)

- 

  True negative

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: A false positive occurs when a scanner detects a vulnerability, but the vulnerability does not exist on the scanned system. A true positive occurs when a scanner detects a vulnerability, and the vulnerability exists on the scanned system. A true negative occurs when a scanner does not detect a vulnerability because the vulnerability does not exist on the scanned system. A false negative occurs when a scanner does not detect a vulnerability, but the vulnerability exists on the scanned system.

  HTTP header injection vulnerability

- 

  Time-to-check to time-to-use flaw

- 

  Zero-day vulnerability

  (正確)

- 

  Input validation flaw

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: A zero-day vulnerability refers to a hole in software unknown to the vendor and newly discovered. This security hole can become exploited by hackers before the vendor becomes aware of it and can fix it. An input validation attack is any malicious action against a computer system that involves manually entering strange information into a normal user input field that is successful due to an input validation flaw. HTTP header injection vulnerabilities occur when user input is insecurely included within server response headers. The time of check to time of use is a class of software bug caused by changes in a system between checking a condition (such as a security credential) and using the check's results and the difference in time passed. This is an example of a race condition.

  Use a tool like ICSSPLOIT to target specific vulnerabilities

- 

  Use social engineering to trick a user into opening a malicious APK

  (正確)

- 

  Use web-based exploits against the devices web interfaces

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: When targeting mobile devices, you must first determine if the company uses iPhones or Android-based devices. If they are using Android-based devices, you can use social engineering to trick a user into installing a malicious APK. As a penetration tester, you can create a malicious APK using msfvenom in the Metasploit framework. The user can install it directly from your website instead of the Google Play store.

Annah is deploying a new application that she received from a vendor, but she is unsure if the hardware is adequate to support a large number of users during peak usage periods. What type of testing could Annah perform to determine if the application will support the required number of users?

- 

  User acceptance testing

- 

  Load testing

  (正確)

- 

  Regression testing

- 

  Fuzz testing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: Load testing or stress testing puts an application, network, or system under full load conditions to document any performance lapses. User Acceptance Testing is the process of verifying that a created solution/software works for a user. Regression testing is defined as software testing to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features. Fuzz testing, or fuzzing, is a quality assurance technique used to discover coding errors and security loopholes in software, operating systems, or networks. It involves inputting massive amounts of random data to the test subject to make it crash. User acceptance testing, regression testing, and fuzz testing are not designed to test a system under heavy load conditions. Therefore, they will not be suitable for Annah's needs in this scenario.

- 

  Buffer overflow

- 

  XML injection

- 

  SQL injection

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: This is an example of a directory traversal. A directory traversal attack aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the webroot folder. By manipulating variables or URLs that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system, including application source code or configuration and critical system files. A buffer overflow is an exploit that attempts to write data to a buffer and exceed that buffer's boundary to overwrite an adjacent memory location. XML Injection is an attack technique used to manipulate or compromise an XML application or service's logic. SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements via web page input.

  You are scanning a CDN-hosted copy of the site

  (正確)

- 

  The server assumes you are conducting a DDoS attack

- 

  The scan will not produce any useful information

- 

  Nothing can be determined about this site with the information provided

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: This result is due to the company using a distributed server model that hosts content on Edge servers worldwide as part of a CDN. A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers that provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end-users. The requested content may be served from the Edge server's cache or pull the content from the main diontraining.com servers. If you are scanning a web server or application hosted with a CDN, you need to be aware that you might be scanning an edge copy of the site and not receive accurate results. While an edge server usually maintains static content, it is still useful to determine if any vulnerabilities exist in that portion of the site content. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks range from small and sophisticated to large and bandwidth-busting. While Akamai does provide excellent DDoS protection capabilities, nothing in this question indicates that the server is attempting to stop your scans or is assuming you are conducting a DDoS attack against it.

You are conducting a wireless penetration test against an organization. During your reconnaissance, you discover that their network is known as "BigCorpWireless" has their SSID broadcast is enabled. You configure your laptop to respond to requests for connection to "BigCorpWireless" and park at the far end of the parking lot. At the end of the workday, as people get in their cars in the parking lot, you see numerous smartphones connecting to your laptop over WiFi. Which of the following exploits did you utilize?

  Downgrade attack

- 

  Fragmentation attack

- 

  Karma attack

  (正確)

- 

  Deauthentication attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.2: A karma attack is a variant of the evil twin attack. A karma attack exploits the behavior of a wireless client trying to connect to its preferred network list. This list contains the SSIDs of access points the device has connected to in the past. When a wireless device is looking to connect to the internet, it firsts beacons to determine if any of these previously connected networks are within range. This allows an attacker to answer the request, allowing the user to connect to them instead as an evil twin. At this point, the attacker is now the on-path between the wireless client and the internet, which is useful for many different exploits. Deauthentication attacks are used in the service of an evil twin, replay, cracking, denial of service, and other attacks. All 802.11 Wi-Fi protocols include a management frame that a client can use to announce that it wishes to terminate a connection with an access point. The victim's device will be kicked off the access point by spoofing the victim's MAC address and sending the deauthentication frame to the access point. A fragmentation attack obtains the pseudorandom generation algorithm (PRGA) of network packets used in WEP. A downgrade attack forces a client to use a weaker SSL version that the attacker can crack.

You conducted a security scan and found that port 389 is being used when connecting to LDAP for user authentication instead of port 636. The security scanning software recommends that you remediate this by changing user authentication to port to 636 wherever possible. What should you do?

- 

  Mark this as a false positive in your audit report since the services that typically run on ports 389 and 636 are identical

- 

  Change all devices and servers that support it to port 636 since port 389 is a reserved port that requires root access and can expose the server to privilege escalation attacks

- 

  Change all devices and servers that support it to port 636 since encrypted services run by default on port 636

  (正確)

- 

  Conduct remediation actions to update encryption keys on each server to match port 636

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: LDAP can be run on either port 389 or port 636. Port 389 is the standard port for LDAP but typically runs unencrypted LDAP services over this port. Instead, you should change all devices and servers that can technically support the change to port 636 since LDAP services over port 636 are encrypted by default.

  Test boundaries

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The timeline of an engagement provides a clear enumeration of the tasks to be performed as part of the penetration test. This is documented in the rules of engagement. This timeline may also include who will perform each task. The timeline does not have to be written to detail the exact day or time of the task but should, at a minimum, provide a logical sequence or order to the engagement. Test boundaries, temporal restrictions, and the location of the team may also be included in the rules of engagement or the scoping documents, but they do not provide a clear enumeration of the tasks to be performed during the penetration test like a timeline does.

Your company has just announced a change to an "API first" model of software development. As a cybersecurity analyst, you are immediately concerned about the possibility of an insecure deserialization vulnerability in this model. Which of the following is the primary basis for an attack against this vulnerability?

- 

  Lack of input validation could allow for a SQL attack

- 

  Lack of input validation could lead to a cross-site scripting attack

- 

  Accepting serialized objects from untrusted sources or the use of serialized non-primitive data may lead to remote code execution

  (正確)

- 

  Insufficient logging and monitoring makes it impossible to detect when insecure deserialization vulnerabilities are exploited

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: When implementing an API, objects in memory from one computer can be serialized and passed to another for deserialization. If the API user is malicious, they may create a fictitious object, appropriately serialize it, and then send it through the API for execution. The only model for defeating this approach is to allow the API to be exposed to trusted sources or to not serialize anything with potentially executable source code (i.e., non-primitive data types). Cross-site scripting and SQL attacks are not a concern for an API first model. While stuffiest logging and monitoring would prevent an analyst from detecting if a deserialization vulnerability was exploited, these alone would not be the basis for an attack against deserialization.

You are conducting passive reconnaissance against an organization as part of your penetration test. You are currently using open-source intelligence to collect information from a company’s open job postings listed on public job boards. Which of the following would you likely NOT find by reviewing their job postings?

- 

  Type of operating system used by the company’s workstations

- 

  Copies of their source code in a public repository

  (正確)

- 

  Types of hardware used by the company

- 

  Programming languages used for in-house developed software

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: Job postings on public job boards can provide information on the personnel makeup of the organization’s departments, the lack of qualified personnel in critical positions, the software architecture and services used by the company, the programming languages used by the company, the types of quantities of hardware used, and the network and security systems used by the company. Copies of their source code in public repositories would not be found on a job posting site and would instead be found on a site like GitHub.

You are reviewing the schedule for an upcoming penetration testing engagement targeting Dion Training. In the rules of engagement, the company specified that “all testing will be conducted during normal business hours (9 am to 5 pm Eastern Time).” You notice that Christina has added a stress test on the company’s webserver to the schedule for Saturday at 2 am. If this test is allowed to be conducted as scheduled, which of the following rules of engagement would the penetration testers be violating?

- 

  Time of day – The stress test is outside the scheduled hours

  (正確)

- 

  Tool use – The stress test uses a tool not specifically allowed in the scope

- 

  Allowable tests – The stress test is not allowed during a penetration test

- 

  Allowable tests – The stress test is not allowed during a penetration test

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The scoping document and the rules of engagement determine what is allowed to be conducted as part of the penetration test. In this scenario, the documents clearly state that testing must occur during normal business hours, therefore this is a violation of the time of day requirements in the scoping documents. Allowable tests define what can and cannot be tested during an assessment. The invasiveness restrictions for the test were not provided in the scenario, and stress testing is often conducted as part of a penetration test. The tools allowed for use were not clearly defined or restricted in the scenario.

If you cannot ping a target because you are receiving no response or a response that states the destination is unreachable, then ICMP may be disabled on the remote end. If you wanted to elicit a response from a host using TCP, what tool would you use?

- 

  Ptunnel

- 

  Hping

  (正確)

- 

  Traceroute

- 

  Broadcast ping

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Hping is a handy little utility that assembles and sends custom ICMP, UDP, or TCP packets and then displays any replies. It was inspired by the ping command but offered far more control over the probes sent. It also has a handy traceroute mode and supports IP fragmentation. Hping is particularly useful when trying to traceroute/ping/probe hosts behind a firewall that blocks attempts using the standard utilities. Hping also allows you to map out firewall rule sets. It is also great for learning more about TCP/IP and experimenting with IP protocols. Hping does not support IPv6, though, so the NMAP creators have created Nping to fill this gap and serve as an updated variant of Hping. Traceroute and tracert are computer network diagnostic commands for displaying the route and measuring packets’ transit delays across an Internet Protocol network. Traceroute uses ICMP and not TCP. Broadcast ping is simply pinging the subnet’s broadcast IP using the ping command, but if a regular ping does not work, neither will a broadcast ping. Ptunnel is an application that allows you to reliably tunnel TCP connections to a remote host using ICMP echo request and reply packets, commonly known as ping requests and replies. Ptunnel is used as a covert channel, not to elicit a response from a host using TCP.

A penetration tester has issued the following command on a victimized host: nc -l -p 8080 | nc 192.168.1.76 443. What will occur based on this command?

- 

  Netcat will listen on port 8080 and output anything received to a remote connection on 192.168.1.76 port 443

  (正確)

- 

  Netcat will listen on port 8080 and then output anything received to local interface 192.168.1.76

- 

  Netcat will listen on the 192.168.1.76 interface for 443 seconds on port 8080

- 

  Netcat will listen for a connection from 192.168.1.76 on port 443 and output anything received to port 8080

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: The proper syntax for netcat (nc) is -l to signify listening and -p to specify the listening port. Then, the | character allows multiple commands to execute during a single command’s execution. Next, netcat sends the data to the given IP (192.168.1.76) over port 443. This is a common technique to bypass the firewall by sending traffic over port 443 (a secure SSL/TLS tunnel).

You are working as a server administrator at Dion Training. You unlock the server room door using your proximity badge and walk through the door. Before the door shuts, another person walks in behind you. What social engineering technique did this person utilize?

- 

  Tailgating

  (正確)

- 

  Shoulder surfing

- 

  Impersonation

- 

  Spoofing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Tailgating is a means of entering a secure area without authorization by following close behind the person that has been allowed to open the door or checkpoint. This might be done without the target's knowledge or might be a means for an insider to allow access to someone without recording it in the building's entry log. Another technique is to persuade someone to hold a door open for them, which would be considered piggybacking. Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering technique used to obtain personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, and other confidential data by looking over the victim's shoulder. Spoofing is the act of disguising a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. Impersonation is the act of pretending to be someone or something else.

Which of the following vulnerabilities can be prevented by using proper input validation? (Select ANY that apply)

- 

  Directory traversal

  XML injection

  (正確)

- 

  Cross-site scripting

  (正確)

- 

  SQL injection

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Proper input validation can prevent cross-site scripting, SQL injection, directory traversal, and XML injections from occurring. When an application accepts string input, the input should be subjected to normalization or sanitization procedures before being accepted. Normalization means that a string is stripped of illegal characters or substrings and converted to the accepted character set. This can prevent SQL and XML injections from occurring. Input validation is also good at preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) in any forms that accept user input. Directory traversals can be prevented by conducting input validation in file paths or URLs accepted from the user. This prevents a canonicalization attack from disguising the nature of the malicious input that could cause a directory traversal.

  Whois

- 

  Burp Suite

- 

  Kismet

  (正確)

- 

  BeEF

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Kismet is an 802.11 Layer 2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system included with Kali Linux. It can monitor wireless activity, identify device types, and capture raw packets for later password cracking. Whois is a protocol that queries databases that store registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name. YASCA (Yet Another Source Code Analyzer) is an open-source SAST program that inspects source code for security vulnerabilities, code quality, and performance. Burp Suite is an integrated platform included for testing web applications' security by acting as a local proxy so that the attacker can capture, analyze, and manipulate HTTP traffic. BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) is a penetration testing tool included with Kali Linux that focuses on web browsers and can be used for XSS and injection attacks against a website.

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: The above example searches for files with the name "password" in them (q=password) and (+) have a filetype equal to xls (filetype%3Axls, %3A is the hex-code for ':') and (+) limits the results to files hosted on diontraining.com (site%3Adiontraining.com) and (&) disables personalization (pws=0) and (&) deactivates the directory filtering function (filter=p). If you wanted to exclude Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, this would be done by typing -filetype%3Axls as part of the search query. To find related websites or pages, you would include the "related:" term to the query. To deactivate all filters from the search, the "filter=0" should be used. To deactivate the directory filtering function, the "filter=p" is used.

You are conducting a penetration test and performing active reconnaissance. You want to configure your tool to probe the target organization’s firewall to determine its rules. Which of the following scan types should you utilize?

- 

  ACK scan

  (正確)

- 

  SYN scan

- 

  XMAS tree scan

- 

  RST scan

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: TCP ACK scans can be used to determine what services are allowed through a firewall. An ACK scan sends TCP packets with only the ACK bit set. Whether ports are open or closed, the target is required to respond with an RST packet. Firewalls that block the probe usually make no response or send back an ICMP destination unreachable error. This distinction allows Nmap to report whether the ACK packets are being filtered. A TCP SYN scan can sometimes be used to determine what ports are filtered. Still, if the firewall is configured to drop packets for disallowed ports instead of sending an RST packet, then a TCP SYN scan will not be able to determine if a firewall was there or if the port was simply unavailable. A target sends a TCP RST packet in response to a TCP ACK scan, but a TCP RST is not a valid type of scan itself. An XMAS Tree scan will set the FIN, PSH, and URG flags in the TCP packet. This is a noisy type of scan and not useful for probing firewall rules.

Which of the following operating systems is most likely used by the host?

- 

  Windows server

- 

  Networked printer

  (正確)

- 

  Windows workstation

- 

  Linux server

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: Based on the open ports, it is likely that the host is a networked printer. Port 515 is used as an LPR/LPD port for most printers and older print servers. Port 631 is used for IPP for most modern printers and CUPS-based print servers. Port 9100 is used as a RAW port for most printers and is also known as the direct-IP port. If any of these three ports are found, the host is likely a printer. If ports 135, 139, 445 are found, this is usually a good indication of a Windows file server. Port such as FTP, telnet, SMTP, and http is used by both Windows and Linux servers; therefore, they are not as helpful to indicate which operating system is in use by the host.

OBJ-4.3: The penetration testing team should have a direct communication path with the system owners or their trusted agents during an engagement. Suppose the team discovers any security breaches, current hacking activity, extremely critical findings on a production server, or a production server becomes unresponsive during exploitation. In that case, the team should stop what they are doing and contract their trusted point of contact within the organization to get further guidance. Deleted log files should be considered an indicator of compromise and should be investigated by the company's security team before you continue with your engagement.

  Buffer overflow exploit

- 

  SQL injection exploit

- 

  Chained exploit

  (正確)

- 

  Denial of Service exploit

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: The script is an example of a chained exploit because it combines several programs into one, including writing to a temporary file, netcat usage, and FTP usage. Chained exploits integrate more than one form of attack to accomplish their goal. A buffer overflow is an anomaly where a program that occurs while writing data to a buffer overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations. SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications. Malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution, such as dumping the database contents to the attacker. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack occurs when legitimate users cannot access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to a malicious cyber threat actor's actions.

  DoS

- 

  On-path attack

  (正確)

- 

  ARP poisoning

- 

  Reflective DNS

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: An on-path attack (previously known as a man-in-the-middle attack) is a general term when a perpetrator positions himself in a conversation between a user and an application, either to eavesdrop or impersonate one of the parties, making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is occurring. For example, if your user and server are both in the United States (English language), but the attacker is performing the on-path attack from Russia, then the server will utilize the Russian language in the certificate errors. A denial-of-service attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting the services of a host connected to the Internet. A reflective DNS attack is a two-step attack used in DDoS attacks. The attacker sends a large number of requests to one or more legitimate DNS servers while using a spoofed source IP of the targeted victim. The DNS server then replies to the spoofed IP and unknowingly floods the targeted victim with responses to DNS requests that it never sent. ARP poisoning or ARP spoofing consists of abusing the weaknesses in ARP to corrupt the MAC-to-IP mappings of other devices on the network.

Several users have contacted the help desk to report that they received an email from a well-known bank stating that their accounts have been compromised and they need to "click here" to reset their banking password. Some of these users are not even customers of this particular bank, though. Which of the following social engineering principles is being utilized as a part of this phishing campaign?

- 

  Urgency

- 

  Familiarity

  (正確)

- 

  Consensus

- 

  Intimidation

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Familiarity is a social engineering technique that relies on assuming a widely known organization's persona. For example, in the United States, nearly 25% of Americans have a Bank of America account. For this reason, phishing campaigns often include emails pretending to be from Bank of America since 1 in 4 people who receive the email in the United States are likely to have an account. This makes them familiar with the bank name and is more likely to click on the email link. This email appears to be untargeted since it was sent to both customers and non-customers of this particular bank; it is best classified as phishing. Spear phishing requires the attack to be more targeted and less widespread. Urgency is focused on the element of time. An attacker encourages the victim to act quickly, which often leads to them making security mistakes. Urgency is related to scarcity, and the two are often effectively used together. Social proof and consensus rely on the fact that people want to fit in and conform. If a victim sees or believes others are performing some action, they will believe it is okay for them to do it.

A company has implemented the capability to send all log files to a centralized server by utilizing an encrypted TLS channel. Once received at the server, the log files are reviewed and analyzed by a cybersecurity analyst. A recently released exploit has caused the company's encryption to become insecure. What would you do to mitigate or correct this vulnerability in the server's implementation of this encrypted TLS channel?

- 

  Utilize SMTP for log file collection

- 

  Utilize an FTP server for log collection

- 

  Configure the firewall to block port 22

- 

  Install a security patch on the server

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Vulnerability patching is the process of checking your operating systems, software, applications, and network components for vulnerabilities that could allow a malicious user to access your system and cause damage, and then applying a security patch or reconfiguring the device to mitigate the vulnerabilities found. If there is a working exploit against the server's encryption protocols, a technician must install a security patch to mitigate or correct this vulnerability. Both FTP and SMTP are considered insecure protocols and transmit data in plain text, therefore they would make the log files even more insecure by using these protocols. Port 22 is used by secure shell (SSH), which is encrypted by default. Blocking port 22 would prevent SSH from being used in the network and would not mitigate the vulnerability identified in this question.

Rick is upset that he was passed over for a promotion. He decides to take revenge on his nemesis, Mary, who got the job instead of him. Rick sets up an on-path attack against Mary's computer by redirecting any layer 2 traffic destined for the gateway to his computer first. Rick is careful only to affect the traffic associated with Mary's computer and not the entire network. Which type of on-path attack is Rick conducting against Mary?

- 

  Evil twin

- 

  MAC spoofing

- 

  ARP poisoning

  (正確)

- 

  IP spoofing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: Based on the scenario, we can eliminate evil twin (focused on wireless access points) and IP spoofing (since this affects layer 3 traffic). While MAC spoofing the gateway's address might work, it would also affect every computer on this subnet. ARP poisoning (also known as ARP spoofing) is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. By conducting an ARP spoofing, Rick can poison the cache and replace Mary's computer's MAC address and IP binding association with his own, allowing him to complete an on-path attack between Mary and the default gateway.

During a penetration test, which of the following should you perform if your goal is to conduct a successful spear phishing attack?

- 

  Send targeted emails with a malicious attachment to the sales team

  Send a targeted email with a malicious attachment to the organization's CEO

- 

  Call the CTO's assistant using a pretext to gather information about their schedule

- 

  Send a text message with a malicious link to the organization's executives

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Spear phishing attacks are crafted to target a specific person or group of people. In this example, you are targeting the sales team with an email. This allows you to create an email that they are more likely to open based on the subject line and its content. Smishing (SMS phishing) is a phishing attack in which the attacker entices their victim through SMS text messages. If the messages are sent by text message, then the attack is considered smishing. Whaling is an email-based or web-based form of phishing that targets senior executives or wealthy individuals. Pretexting is a social engineering tactic where a team will communicate, whether directly or indirectly, a lie or half-truth to get someone to believe a falsehood.

  PsExec

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is a technology that provides an HTTP Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) standard for specific remote management services on Windows systems. These remote management services enable you to issue commands to remote systems without using an interactive shell. PsExec is a Windows-based remote access service that doesn’t require prior setup on the host being accessed remotely. Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provides an interface for local or remote computer management to provide information about the status of hosts, configure security settings, and manipulate environment variables. A scheduled task is any instance of execution, such as the initiation of a process or running a script, that the system performs on a set schedule.

What nmap switch would you use to perform operating system detection?

- 

  -OS

- 

  -O

  (正確)

- 

  -s0

- 

  -sP

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: The –O switch is used to tell nmap to conduct fingerprinting of the operating system based on the responses received during scanning. Nmap will then report on the suspected operating system of the scanned host. If you use –O –v, you will get additional details, as this runs the operating system scan in verbose mode. The -OS flag is made up and not supported by nmap. The -s0 flag conducts an IP protocol scan of the target. The -sP flag conducts a simple ping scan against the target.

Your company is expanding its operations in the European Union and is concerned about additional governmental regulations that may apply. Which of the following regulations applies when processing personal data within the European Union?

- 

  PCI

- 

  PII

- 

  PHI

- 

  GDPR

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation created in the European Union that creates provisions and requirements to protect the personal data of European Union (EU) citizens. Transfers of personal data outside the EU Single Market are restricted unless protected by like-for-like regulations, such as the US’s Privacy Shield requirements. Personally identifiable information (PII) is data used to identify, contact, or locate an individual. Information such as social security number (SSN), name, date of birth, email address, telephone number, street address, and biometric data is considered PII. Protected health information (PHI) refers to medical and insurance records, plus associated hospital and laboratory test results. The peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus is used to provide low-speed connectivity to expansion cards but has been mostly replaced by the faster PCIe bus. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) applies to companies of any size that accept credit card payments. If your company intends to accept card payment and store, process, and transmit cardholder data, you need to securely host your data and follow PCI compliance requirements.

Which of the following techniques does a vulnerability scanner use to detect a vulnerability on a specific service?

- 

  Fuzzing

- 

  Banner grabbing

- 

  Port scanning

- 

  Analyzing the response received from the service when probed

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: When a vulnerability scanner analyzes the response received from services during a scan or probe, it can determine if the vulnerability exists on the given service on a particular host. Port Scanning is the name for the technique used to identify open ports and services available on a network host. Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. Banner grabbing is a technique used to gain information about a computer system on a network and the services running on its open ports.

Which of the following command-line tools would you use to identify open ports and services on a host along with the version of the application that is associated with them?

- 

  nmap

  (正確)

- 

  netstat

- 

  Wireshark

- 

  ping

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Nmap sends specially crafted packets to the target host(s) and then analyzes the responses to determine the open ports and services running on those hosts. Also, nmap can determine the versions of the applications being used on those ports and services. Nmap is a command-line tool for use on Linux, Windows, and macOS systems. The netstat (network statistics) tool is a command-line utility that displays network connections for incoming and outgoing TCP packets, routing tables, and some network interface and network protocol statistics. Still, it cannot identify open ports and services on a host with their version numbers. The ping tool is used to query another computer on a network to determine whether there is a valid connection. Wireshark is an open-source packet analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.

- 

  TXT

- 

  SRV

- 

  NS

- 

  MX

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: Mail Exchange (MX) records are used to provide the mail server that accepts email messages for a particular domain. Nameserver (NS) records are used to list the authoritative DNS server for a particular domain. Text (TXT) records are used to provide information about a resource such as a server, network, or service in human-readable form. They often contain domain verification and domain authentications for third-party tools that can send information on behalf of a domain name. Service (SRV) records are used to provide host and port information on services such as voice over IP (VoIP) and instant messaging (IM) applications.

  Input validation

  (正確)

- 

  Network layer firewalls

- 

  CSRF

- 

  Hypervisors

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Input validation prevents the attacker from sending invalid data to an application and is a strong control against both SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks. A network layer firewall is a device that is designed to prevent unauthorized access, thereby protecting the computer network. It blocks unauthorized communications into the network and only permits authorized access based on the IP address, ports, and protocols in use. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is another attack type. A hypervisor controls access between virtual machines.

David noticed that port 3389 was open on one of the POS terminals in a store during a scheduled PCI compliance scan. Based on the scan results, what service should he expect to find enabled on this terminal?

- 

  MySQL

- 

  LDAP

- 

  RDP

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Port 3389 is an RDP port used for the Remote Desktop Protocol. If this port isn’t supposed to be opened, then an incident response plan should be the next step since this can be used for remote access by an attacker. MySQL runs on port 3306. LDAP runs on port 389. IMAP over SSL runs on port 993.

A cybersecurity analyst just finished conducting an initial vulnerability scan and is reviewing their results. To avoid wasting time on results that are not related to actual vulnerabilities, the analyst wants to remove any false positives before remediating the findings. Which of the following is an indicator that something in their results would be a false positive?

- 

  Items classified by the system as Low or as For Informational Purposes Only

  (正確)

- 

  An HTTPS entry that indicates the web page is securely encrypted

- 

  A finding that shows the scanner compliance plug-ins are not up-to-date

- 

  A scan result that shows a version that is different from the automated asset inventory

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: When conducting a vulnerability scan, it is common for the report to include some findings that are classified as “low” priority or “for informational purposes only.” These are most likely false positives and can be ignored by the analyst when starting their remediation efforts. "An HTTPS entry that indicates the web page is securely encrypted" is not a false positive but a true negative (a non-issue). A scan result showing a different version from the automated asset inventory should be investigated and is likely a true positive. A finding that shows the scanner compliance plug-ins are not up-to-date would likely also be a true positive that should be investigated.

You are planning to exploit a network-based vulnerability against a Windows server. You have determined that it is vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit because the system hasn't installed the MS17-010 security patch. From your research, you know that this exploit would allow you to conduct arbitrary remote code execution by exploiting a fault in the communication protocol used by Windows file and print servers. Which of the following types of exploits are you planning?

What kind of attack is an example of IP spoofing?

- 

  SQL injections

- 

  Cross-site scripting

- 

  ARP poisoning

- 

  On-path attack

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: An on-path attack (formerly known as a man-in-the-middle attack) intercepts communications between two systems. For example, in an HTTP transaction, the target is the TCP connection between client and server. Using different techniques, the attacker splits the original TCP connection into 2 new connections, one between the client and the attacker and the other between the attacker and the server. This often uses IP spoofing to trick a victim into connecting to the attack. SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications. Malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution, such as dumping the database contents to the attacker. An on-path attack is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other. ARP Poisoning, also known as ARP Spoofing, is a type of cyber attack carried out over a Local Area Network (LAN) that involves sending malicious ARP packets to a default gateway on a LAN to change the pairings in its IP to MAC address table. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in a browser side script, to a different end-user.

Jorge is working with an application team to remediate a critical SQL injection vulnerability on a public-facing server. The team is worried that deploying the fix will require several hours of downtime and block customer transactions from being completed by the server. Which of the following is the BEST action for Jorge to recommend?

- 

  Delay the remediation until the next major update of the SQL server occurs

- 

  Remediate the vulnerability immediately

- 

  Schedule an emergency maintenance for an off-peak time later in the day to remediate the vulnerability

  (正確)

- 

  Wait until the next scheduled maintenance window to remediate the vulnerability

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Jorge should recommend that emergency maintenance windows be scheduled for an off-peak time later in the day. Since the vulnerability is critical, it needs to be remediated or mitigated as quickly as possible. But, this also needs to be balanced against the business and operational needs. Therefore, we cannot simply remediate it immediately, as this would cause downtime for this public-facing server. It is also unreasonable to accept the risk until the next scheduled maintenance window since it is a critical vulnerability. Therefore, the best way to balance the risk of the vulnerability and the outage's risk is to schedule an emergency maintenance window and patch the server during that time.

  Immediately contact the organization and inform them of the issue

  (正確)

- 

  Contact the organization's customer service department and conduct further information gathering

- 

  Continue with the exploitation

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.3: If at any point during an assessment, an issue arises due to your actions, then you should immediately stop exploitation and contact the trusted point of contact provided by the organization. You should not continue your exploitation or pivot to another machine. While you may contact the organization's customer service department, you first need to verify if that is part of the allowed communication procedures outlined in the assessment plan. If you are conducting a red team event, the customer service team may be the target and not be informed of the issues directly. As a pentester, you should notify your trusted point of contact within the organization, per your approved test plan.

An analyst's vulnerability scanner did not have the latest set of signatures installed. Due to this, several unpatched servers may have vulnerabilities that were undetected by their scanner. You have directed the analyst to update their vulnerability scanner with the latest signatures at least 24 hours before conducting any scans. However, the results of their scans still appear to be the same. Which of the following logical controls should you use to address this situation?

- 

  Ensure the analyst manually validates that the updates are being performed as directed

- 

  Configure the vulnerability scanners to run a credentialed scan

- 

  Create a script to automatically update the signatures every 24 hours

  (正確)

- 

  Test the vulnerability remediations in a sandbox before deploying them into production

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Since the analyst appears not to be installing the latest vulnerability signatures according to your instructions, it would be best to create a script and automate the process to eliminate human error. The script will always ensure that the latest signatures are downloaded and installed in the scanner every 24 hours without any human intervention. While you may want the analyst to manually validate the updates were performed as part of their procedures, this is still error-prone and likely not to be conducted properly. Regardless of whether the scanners are being run in uncredentialed or credentialed mode, they will still miss vulnerabilities if using out-of-date signatures. Finally, the option to test the vulnerability remediations in a sandbox is a good suggestion. Still, it won't solve this scenario since we are concerned with the scanning portion or vulnerability management and not remediation.

Which of the following best describes what actions this line of code will perform?

- 

  Sequentially sent 255 ping packets to every host on the subnet

- 

  Attempted to conduct a SYN scan on the network

- 

  Conducted a ping sweep of the subnet

  (正確)

- 

  Conducted a sequential ICMP echo reply to the subnet

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: This line of Bash scripting will perform a ping sweep of the subnet 172.16.1.0/24. The script states that for every number in the sequence from 1 to 255, the program should conduct a ping to 172.16.1.x, where x is a number from 1 to 255. Once the sequence is completed, the script will terminate and return to the terminal prompt (done). The ping command uses an echo request and then receives an echo reply from the ping's target. A ping sweep does not use an SYN scan, which requires the use of a tool like Nmap or Hping instead.

Fail to Pass Systems has recently moved its corporate offices from France to Westeros, a country with no meaningful privacy regulations. The marketing department believes that this move will allow the company to resell all of its customer's data to third-party companies and shield the company from any legal responsibility. Which policy is violated by this scenario?

- 

  Data minimization

- 

  Data enrichment

- 

  Data limitation

- 

  Data sovereignty

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: While the fictitious Westeros may have no privacy laws or regulations, the laws of the countries where the company's customers reside may still retain sovereignty over the data obtained from those regions during the company's business there. This is called Data Sovereignty. Data sovereignty refers to a jurisdiction (such as France or the European Union) preventing or restricting processing and storage from taking place on systems that do not physically reside within that jurisdiction. Data sovereignty may demand certain concessions on your part, such as using location-specific storage facilities in a cloud service. Fail to Pass Systems will likely face steep fines from different regions if they go through with their plan to sell all of their customers' data to the highest bidders. Fail to Pass Systems may even be blocked from communicating with individual regions. Although Data minimization and data limitation policies may be violated depending on the company's internal policies, these policies are not legally binding like the provisions of GDPR are. Data enrichment means that the machine analytics behind the view of a particular alert can deliver more correlating and contextual information with a higher degree of confidence, both from within the local network’s data points and from external threat intelligence.

  Physical location

- 

  Autonomous system number (ASN)

- 

  API (Application Programming Interface)

  (正確)

- 

  SSID (Service Set Identifier)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: An application programming interface (API) is a library of programming utilities used to connect computers or computer programs. APIs are commonly used in cloud-based applications and public-facing web applications. Autonomous System Number (ASN) is a globally unique identifier that defines a group of one or more IP prefixes run by one or more network operators that maintain a single, clearly defined routing policy. These groups of IP prefixes are known as autonomous systems. The SSID (Service Set Identifier) is a group of wireless network devices that share a common natural language name or identifier. When conducting a wireless penetration test, it is important to have the names of the SSIDs that are in the scope of your assessment. Physical locations define which buildings or locations may be targeted as part of the assessment.

Dion Training is hiring a penetration testing firm to conduct an assessment of its corporate network. As part of the contract, the company has specified that it will not provide any network details to the penetration testing firm. Instead, the company wants to see how much information about the network can be found by the penetration testers using open-source research and scanning the corporate network. What type of assessment is this considered?

- 

  Semi-trusted environment testing

- 

  Known environment testing

- 

  Partially known environment testing

- 

  Unknown environment testing

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: An unknown environment penetration test requires no previous information and usually takes the approach of an uninformed attacker. The penetration tester has no prior information about the target system or network in an unknown environment penetration test. These tests provide a realistic scenario for testing the defenses, but they can be costlier and more time-consuming to conduct as the tester is examining a system from an outsider’s perspective. A partially known environment tester has the user’s access and knowledge levels, potentially with elevated privileges on a system. These partially known environment penetration testers typically have some knowledge of a network’s internals, potentially including design and architecture documentation and an account internal to the network. A known environment test is known by several different names, including clear-box, open-box, auxiliary, or logic-driven testing. It falls on the opposite end of the spectrum from an unknown environment test because the penetration testers have full access to source code, architecture documentation, and so forth. A known environment penetration tester can also perform static code analysis, so familiarity with source code analyzers, debuggers, and similar tools are necessary for this type of testing. A semi-trusted environment test is made up term and is used as a distractor in this question.

OBJ-2.3: As shown in the Nmap scan output, only two standard ports are being utilized: 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP). But, when netcat was run against port 80, the banner grab output indicates that the SMTP server is running on port 80. SMTP normally operates on port 25 by default, so running it on port 80 means the email server (SMTP) is running on a non-standard port. Based on the output provided, there is no way to know if the email server or web server has already been compromised by an attacker. The SSH server is running on the standard port (22).

Dion Training wants to install a perimeter device on the network to block any FTP commands that an attacker might try to send over port 25. Which of the following devices would allow for deep packet inspection to catch this type of activity?

- 

  Web proxy

- 

  Layer 3 switch

- 

  Web application firewall

  (正確)

- 

  Protocol analyzer

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: An application-aware firewall or web application firewall (WAF) can make decisions about what applications are allowed or blocked by a firewall, as opposed to simply using IP addresses and port numbers, by applications by inspecting the data contained within the packets. This is also known as deep packet inspection (DPI). A web proxy is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource. A web proxy is used to monitor, inspect, or block web traffic between a client and a remote server, not FTP traffic. A layer 3 switch, or multilayer switch, is a switch that is capable of performing the functions of a router. Layer 3 switches allow for the use of ACLs, but only at layer 3 and therefore could not inspect the packets containing FTP commands being sent over port 25. A network protocol analyzer is a tool used to monitor data traffic and analyze captured signals as they travel across communication channels. While a protocol analyzer could be used to observe the FTP commands being sent over port 25, it would not be able to block them.

OBJ-3.1: Wireless access points can utilize MAC filtering to ensure only known network interface cards are allowed to connect to the network. If the hacker changes their MAC address to a trusted MAC address, they can easily bypass this security mechanism. MAC filtering is considered a good security practice as part of a larger defense-in-depth strategy, but it won't stop a skilled hacker for long. MAC addresses are permanently burned into the network interface card by the manufacturer and serve as the device's physical address. WEP is the Wired Equivalent Privacy encryption standard, which is considered obsolete in modern wireless networks. WEP can be broken using a brute force attack within just a few minutes by an attacker. Another security technique is to disable the SSID broadcast of an access point. While this prevents the SSID broadcast, a skilled attacker can still find the SSID using discovery scanning techniques. WPS is the WiFi Protected Setup. WPS is used to connect and configure wireless devices to an access point easily.

You are analyzing the logs of a web server and see the following entry: 

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_05-07-06-5b8f333fb77b66777423df9ae65b91f5.png)

Based on this entry, which of the following attacks was attempted?

- 

  Buffer overflow

- 

  XML injection

- 

  SQL injection

- 

  XSS

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: This is an example of an XSS attack as recorded by a web server's log. In this example, the XSS attack was obfuscated by the attacker using HTML encoding. The encoding of %27%27 translates to two single quote marks (' '). While you don't need to be able to decode the exact string used in the logs, when you see HTML encoding on the exam, it is usually going to be an XSS attack unless you see SQL or XML statements in the string, which in this case there are neither of those. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks use a specially crafted URL that includes attack code that will cause user information entered into their web browser to be sent to the attacker. An attacker finds a web server vulnerable to XSS and sends a legitimate-looking URL with XSS attack code appended to the end of the URL through a phishing email or other message to trick the user into clicking the link. A buffer overflow attempts to write data to a buffer that overruns the buffer's boundary and writes data into the adjacent memory locations, which is not occurring in this example.

In which type of non-technical attack does an attacker attempt to trick a user into providing sensitive information?

- 

  Evil twin

- 

  On-path

- 

  Social engineering

  (正確)

- 

  Bluesnarfing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Social engineering is the art of convincing people to reveal confidential information to the intruder. Bluesnarfing is the unauthorized access of information from a wireless device through a Bluetooth connection. Bluesnarfing is a technical exploit, not one that relies on tricking a user like social engineering would. An on-path attack, formerly known as a man-in-the-middle attack, is a technical method used by attackers to place themselves between a victim's client and a server to intercept or modify communications between the two devices. This is another form of technical attack and it does not rely on tricking a user. An evil twin a rogue wireless access point that masquerades as a legitimate Wi-Fi access point so that an attacker can gather personal or corporate information without the user's knowledge. An evil twin is another technical means of attack that could be combined with an on-path attack to collect sensitive information from a victim. The best answer, though, still is a social engineering attack since those manipulate and trick a user into directly providing sensitive information to an attacker.

When you click submit on the search form, your web browser returns a pop-up window that displays Vulnerable_to_Attack. Which of the following vulnerabilities did you discover in the web application?

- 

  Command injection

- 

  SQL injection

- 

  Cross-site request forgery

- 

  Cross-site scripting

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: This is a form of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Attackers may use a cross-site scripting vulnerability to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. There are many ways in which a malicious website can transmit commands, such as specially-crafted image tags, hidden forms, and JavaScript XMLHttpRequests can all work without the user's interaction or even knowledge. SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications. Malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution, such as dumping the database contents to the attacker. Command injection is an attack in which the goal is to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user-supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers, etc.) to a system shell.

BigCorpData recently had suffered a massive data breach caused by a hacker. You have been hired as an expert to assist in their incident response and recovery. You look through the shell history on a Linux server and see the following entry: # echo " " > /var/log/syslog. Which of the following techniques did the attacker use to attempt to cover their tracks?

- 

  Clearing specific syslog entries

- 

  Clearing the syslog file

  (正確)

- 

  Erasing the syslog file securely

- 

  Changing or forging syslog entries

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: The attacker issued attempted to overwrite the /var/log/syslog file. If this command were successful, they would have overwritten all of the log's contents with a single space character. If the server writes its logs to a centralized Syslog server, the original logs would still be available for review. Additionally, this method does not securely erase the file, and it could be restored from a backup or even from the hard drive using forensic techniques. If the attacker wanted to erase the file securely, they should have used the "shred -zu /var/log/syslog" command. This would overwrite the area of the hard drive that contained the file with zeros for increased security.

You received an incident response report indicating a piece of malware was introduced into the company’s network through a remote workstation connected to the company’s servers over a VPN connection. Which of the following controls should be applied to prevent this type of incident from occurring again?

- 

  ACL

- 

  MAC filtering

- 

  SPF

- 

  NAC

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Network Access Control (NAC) is an approach to computer security that attempts to unify endpoint security technology (such as anti-virus, host intrusion prevention, and vulnerability assessment), user or system authentication, and network security enforcement. When a remote workstation connects to the network, NAC will place it into a segmented portion of the network (sandbox), scan it for malware and validate its security controls, and then based on the results of those scans, either connect it to the company’s networks or place the workstation into a separate quarantined portion of the network for further remediation. An access control list (ACL) is a network traffic filter that can control incoming or outgoing traffic. An ACL alone would not have prevented this issue. MAC Filtering refers to a security access control method whereby the MAC address assigned to each network card is used to determine access to the network. MAC filtering operates at layer 2 and is easy to bypass. Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication method designed to detect forging sender addresses during email delivery.

A military defense contracting company has hired your company to conduct a penetration test against their networks. Their company has a strong vulnerability management program in place, but they are concerned that they may still be subject to remote hackers' intrusion. They have asked your company to create a red team with their most skilled hackers and conduct a long-term engagement over 6-12 months. The goal of this assessment is to emulate an attacking group that uses stealth while infiltrating the network, quietly maintaining persistence, and slowly exfiltrating data out of the network over time to determine if their cybersecurity analysts could detect this type of threat. Which of the following type of threat actors will your red team need to emulate?

- 

  APT

  (正確)

- 

  Insider threat

- 

  Script kiddies

- 

  Hacktivists

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a type of attacker that keeps a low profile while infiltrating a remote network. Once inside the network, they maintain their patience while gathering intelligence and slowly exfiltrating data out of the network. Many APTs work for a nation-state and focus on intelligence operations. Some APTs also perform corporate espionage to steal highly guarded trade secrets from competitors. APTs commonly use several attack vectors to ensure their success in gaining unauthorized access to information.

Ryan needs to verify the installation of a critical Windows patch on his organization's workstations. Which method would be the most efficient to validate the current patch status for all of the organization's Windows 10 workstations?

- 

  Use an endpoint manager to validate patch status for each machine on the domain

  (正確)

- 

  Create and run a PowerShell script to search for the specific patch in question

- 

  Check the Update History manually

- 

  Conduct a registry scan of each workstation to validate the patch was installed

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: The Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM) provides remote control, patch management, software distribution, operating system deployment, network access protection, and hardware and software inventory. In an Azure environment, you can also use the Update Compliance tool to monitor your device's Windows updates, Windows Defender anti-virus status, and the up-to-date patching status across all of your Windows 10 workstations. In previous Windows versions, you could use the Microsoft Baseline Analyzer (MSBA), but that is no longer supported when Windows 10 was introduced. A PowerShell script may be a reasonable option, but it would take a knowledgeable analyst to create the script and scan the network, whereas using SCCM is easier and quicker. Manually checking the Update History or registry of each system could also work, but that is very time-consuming and inefficient, especially if Ryan is supporting a large network.

Which type of threat will patches NOT effectively combat as a security control?

- 

  Discovered software bugs

- 

  Zero-day attacks

  (正確)

- 

  Known vulnerabilities

- 

  Malware with defined indicators of compromise

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Zero-day attacks have no known fix, so patches will not correct them. A zero-day vulnerability is a computer-software vulnerability that is unknown to, or unaddressed by, those who should be interested in mitigating the vulnerability (including the vendor of the target software). If a discovered software bug or known vulnerability is found, a patch or mitigation is normally available. If a piece of malware has well-defined indicators of compromise, a patch or signature can be created to defend against it, as well.

You want to exploit the NETBIOS name service on a Windows-based network. Which of the following tools should you use?

- 

  Nessus

- 

  Arpspoof

- 

  Responder

  (正確)

- 

  John the Ripper

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Responder provides a fake server and relay tool that is included with Kali Linux. It responds to LLMNR, NBT-NS (NETBIOS), POP, IMAP, SMTP, and SQL queries to recover sensitive information such as user names and passwords. Responder is configured to listen for LLMNR/NBNS queries and respond with itself as the desired destination. When the client then tries to connect, it prompts the user to log on based on the client's protocol, thus harvesting the user's credentials. Nessus is a popular vulnerability scanner with a module dedicated to reporting that can be helpful during the presentation of your findings in a penetration test. The arpspoof software provided by the dsniff library is used by an attacker to perform an ARP spoofing attack on the victim.

You are conducting a penetration test against an organization. You have captured the legitimate authentication handshake between a client and a server. Later in the day, you retransmit that session while spoofing your MAC address to that of the client. Which of the following exploits are you using?

- 

  Replay attack

  (正確)

- 

  Downgrade attack

- 

  Fragmentation attack

- 

  Relay attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.2: A replay attack repeats a legitimate transmission in a malicious context. For example, a user might send their authentication information to a client or system; the attacker who eavesdrops on this communication can use the authentication in a later transmission, essentially impersonating the victim. In wireless networking, replaying transmissions can be used to enable several different attacks. Do not confuse a replay attack with a relay attack. In a replay attack, a legitimate network packet or frame is retransmitted repeatedly. In a relay attack, an attacker inserts themselves on-path between two devices, intercepting and forwarding traffic between them. A fragmentation attack obtains the pseudorandom generation algorithm (PRGA) of network packets used in WEP. A downgrade attack forces a client to use a weaker SSL version that the attacker can crack.

Based on the output above, which of the following types of vulnerabilities is Jason exploiting?

- 

  Insecure sudo

- 

  Insecure file/folder permissions

- 

  Unquoted service paths

- 

  Writeable services

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: Some Windows services are run with SYSTEM privileges and may have been misconfigured by the administrator. In this case, Jason used the accesschk tool from SysInternals to find any writeable services that his user account could access. One was returned: Apache. He then stopped the service and rewrote the binary path loaded by the service to "net localgroup administrators jason /add", which will be run the next time the service is started. This will add Jason's user account (jason) to the administrators group. Next, he started the service, completing his privilege escalation through the use of writeable services.

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: The nc (netcat) command is useful in conducting banner grabbing. To use netcat for banner grabbing, simply enter “nc -v IP PORT” where IP is the IP address and PORT is the port number of the service being tested. In this scenario, netcat is being used to banner grab the server on port 22, therefore you should expect the result to be a SSH (secure shell) server.
