Which of the following penetration testing methodologies or frameworks was developed by business professionals as a best practice guide for conducting penetration tests?

- 

  OWASP Testing Guide (OTG)

- 

  Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)

  (正確)

- 

  Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF)

- 

  Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) was developed by business professionals as a best practice guide for conducting penetration testing. The PTES contains seven main sections that are used to provide a comprehensive overview of the proper structure of a complete penetration test. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an organization aimed at increasing awareness of web security and provides a framework for testing during each phase of the software development process. The OWASP Testing Guide (OTG) provides different steps for the testing process and outlines the importance of assessing the entire organization, including the people, processes, and technology, during a penetration test. The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) was developed by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM) and it outlines every area of an organization that needs testing and how to conduct the relevant tests. The Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) is an open-source resource available to cybersecurity professionals. The ISSAF is comprised of documents that relate to penetration testing, such as guidelines on business continuity and disaster recovery along with legal and regulatory compliance.

Tim is working to prevent any remote login attacks to the root account of a Linux system. What method would be the best option to stop attacks like this while still allowing normal users to connect using ssh?

- 

  Add root to the sudoers group

- 

  Change sshd_config to deny root login

  (正確)

- 

  Add a network IPS rule to block root logins

- 

  Add an iptables rule blocking root logins

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Linux systems use the sshd (SSH daemon) to provide ssh connectivity. If Tim changes the sshd_config to deny root logins, it will still allow any authenticated non-root user to connect over ssh. The sshd service has a configuration setting that is named PermitRootLogin. If you set this configuration setting to no or deny, all root logins will be denied by the ssh daemon. If you didn't know about this setting, you could still answer this question by using the process of elimination. An iptables rule is a Linux firewall rule, and this would block the port for ssh, not the root login. Adding root to the sudoers group won't help either since the sudoers group allows users to login as root. If you have a network IPS rule to block root logins, the IPS would have to see the traffic being sent within the SSH tunnel. This is not possible since SSH connections are encrypted end-to-end by default. Therefore, the only possible right answer is to change the sshd_config setting to deny root logins.

You are preparing for an upcoming penetration test. You want to begin your reconnaissance but need to validate the scope of the IP addresses and the times of day you can scan the network. Which of the following documents should you refer to find these details?

- 

  MSA

- 

  ROE

  (正確)

- 

  RFP

- 

  NDA

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The rules of engagement (ROE) contain the timeline, location, temporal restrictions, transparency of testing, and test boundaries for the penetration test. Therefore, if you look at the temporal restrictions portion of the ROE, you will see what times of day you can perform your scans and exploits. If you reference the test boundaries section, it should contain what types of scanning and exploits are allowed to be used and which systems are and are not in the scope of the assessment.

The analyst contacts the web developer and asks for a copy of the source code to the logon.php script. The script is as follows:

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_04-54-02-5ea29aa1e89214cbc08f3961e19b9304.png)

Based on source code analysis, which type of vulnerability is this web server vulnerable to?

- 

  LDAP injection

- 

  SQL injection

  (正確)

- 

  Directory traversal

- 

  Command injection

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: Based on the log entries, it appears the attack was successful in conducting a SQL injection. Notice the escape character (') used in the log. A connection to the MySQL database is being used in the script, which could be exploited since no input validation is being performed. Command injection is an attack in which the goal is to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. SQL injection is a specific type of command injection. LDAP injection is a code injection technique used to exploit web applications that could reveal sensitive user information or modify information represented in the LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) data stores. Directory traversal or Path Traversal is an HTTP attack that allows attackers to access restricted directories and execute commands outside of the web server's root directory.

問題 7：

Which of the following would trigger the penetration test to stop and contact the system owners during an engagement?

- 

  A production server is unresponsive after attempting exploitation

  (正確)

- 

  Discovery of two servers not documented in the architecture diagrams

- 

  Discovery of encrypted PII personal data being stored on the system

- 

  A production server is unresponsive to ping requests

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.3: The penetration testing team should have a direct communication path with the system owners or their trusted agents during an engagement. If the team discovers any security breaches, current hacking activity, extremely critical findings on a production server, or a production server becomes unresponsive during exploitation, then the team should stop what they are doing and contract their trusted point of contact within the organization to get further guidance.

What popular open-source port scanning tool is commonly used for host discovery and service identification?

- 

  Nessus

- 

  services.msc

- 

  dd

- 

  nmap

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: The world's most popular open-source port scanning utility is nmap. The Services console (services.msc) allows an analyst to disable or enable Windows services. The dd tool is used to copy files, disks, and partitions, and it can also be used to create forensic disk images. Nessus is a proprietary vulnerability scanner developed by Tenable. While Nessus does contain the ability to conduct a port scan, its primary role is as a vulnerability scanner, and it is not an open-source tool.

You are working as part of a penetration testing team. You look over the shoulder of your team members and see the following sample of network traffic in Wireshark:

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_04-48-10-83ad3069b3a1b2a6d6ebbfdd338b2ae8.png)

Which of the following types of Nmap scans was run against the target based on the network traffic shown above?

- 

  NULL scan

- 

  FIN scan

- 

  XMAS Tree scan

  (正確)

- 

  TCP SYN scan

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: The XMAS Tree Scan sends a packet with the FIN, URG, and PSH flags set and it is an extremely noisy scan to perform against a target. A TCP SYN scan is a stealth scan that sends a packet to the target with just the SYN flag set. This is what is displayed in this network traffic capture in Wireshark in this scenario. A FIN scan is used to send a packet to the target with only the FIN flag set. The NULL scan is a packet sent without any flags set.

You are preparing for the exploitation of Dion Training's systems as part of a penetration test. During your research, you determined that Dion Training is using application containers for each of its websites. You believe that these containers are all hosted on the same physical underlying server. Which of the following components should you attempt to exploit to gain access to all of the websites at once?

- 

  Their e-commerce website's web application

- 

  Common libraries

  (正確)

- 

  Configuration files

- 

  Hypervisor vulnerability

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: Application containers are virtualized environments designed to package and run a single computing application or service and share the same host kernel. Since they share the same host kernel, they use common libraries, as well. If you can exploit the common libraries, you will gain access to every website on that server, even if they are in an application container. An application container does not use a hypervisor like a typical virtual machine. Configuration files are unique to each application container. The e-commerce website's web application is likely hosted in a single application container and, therefore, would not provide you access to every website simultaneously if exploited.

  Credential harvesting

  (正確)

- 

  Proxying a connection

- 

  Network enumeration

- 

  Establishing a bind shell

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: This snippet of a Ruby script comes from the Metasploit framework as part of its credcollect.rb script. Most of the meterpreter scripts in Metasploit are written in Ruby, as it quickly became one of the favorite languages of penetration testers. Even if you cannot read and understand this entire script, you should identify some keywords and phrases to guess the correct answer. For example, line 6 mentions sam_hashes, which is used in Windows authentication. The script then extracts the data from the sam_hases for each username and password it could find and stores it in the client (Metasploit) database. For the exam, you need to read a script and understand its basic workflow and functions.

John is a cybersecurity consultant that wants to sell his services to an organization. In preparation for his first meeting with the client, John wants to conduct a vulnerability scan of their network to show the client how much they need his services. What is the most significant issue with John conducting this scan of the organization’s network?

- 

  John does not know what operating systems and applications are in use

- 

  The client’s infrastructure design is unknown to John

- 

  John does not have permission to perform the scan

  (正確)

- 

  The IP range of the client systems is unknown by John

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.1: All options listed are an issue, but the most significant issue is that John does not have the client’s permission to perform the scan. A vulnerability scan may be construed as a form of reconnaissance, penetration testing, or even an attack on the organization’s systems. A cybersecurity analyst should never conduct a vulnerability scan on another organization’s network without explicit written permission. In some countries, a vulnerability scan against an organization’s network without their permission is considered a cybercrime and could result in jail time for the consultant.

Tamera just purchased a Wi-Fi-enabled Nest Thermostat for her home. She has hired you to install it, but she is worried about a hacker breaking into the thermostat since it is an IoT device. Which of the following is the BEST thing to do to mitigate Tamera's security concerns? (Select TWO)

- 

  Disable wireless connectivity to the thermostat to ensure a hacker cannot access it

- 

  Configure the thermostat to connect to the wireless network using WPA2 encryption and a long, strong password

  (正確)

- 

  Upgrade the firmware of the wireless access point to the latest version to improve the security of the network

- 

  Enable two-factor authentication on the device's website (if supported by the company)

- 

  Configure the thermostat to use a segregated part of the network by installing it into a screened subnet

  (正確)

- 

  Configure the thermostat to use the WEP encryption standard for additional confidentiality

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: The BEST options are to configure the thermostat to use the WPA2 encryption standard (if supported) and place any Internet of Things (IoT) devices into a DMZ/screened subnet to segregate them from the production network. While enabling two-factor authentication on the device's website is a good practice, it will not increase the IoT device's security. While disabling the wireless connectivity to the thermostat will ensure it cannot be hacked, it also will make the device ineffective for the customer's normal operational needs. WEP is considered a weak encryption scheme, so you should use WPA2 over WEP whenever possible. Finally, upgrading the wireless access point's firmware is good for security, but it isn't specific to the IoT device's security. Therefore, it is not one of the two BEST options.

Dion Consulting Group has just won a contract to provide updates to an employee payroll system originally written years ago in C++. During your assessment of the source code, you notice the command "strcpy" is being used in the application. Which of the following provides is cause for concern, and what mitigation would you recommend to overcome it?

- 

  strcpy could allow an integer overflow to occur; upgrade the operating system to run ASLR to prevent a buffer overflow

- 

  strcpy could allow an integer overflow to occur; you should rewrite the entire system in Java

- 

  strcpy could allow a buffer overflow to occur; you should rewrite the entire system in Java

- 

  strcpy could allow a buffer overflow to occur; upgrade the operating system to run ASLR to prevent a buffer overflow

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: C and C++ contain built-in functions such as strcpy that do not provide a default mechanism for checking if data will overwrite the boundaries of a buffer. The developer must identify such insecure functions and ensure that every call made to them by the program is performed securely. Many development projects use higher-level languages, such as Java, Python, and PHP. These interpreted languages will halt execution if an overflow condition is detected. However, changing languages may be infeasible in an environment that relies heavily on legacy code. By ensuring that the operating system supports ASLR, you can make it impossible for a buffer overflow to work by randomizing where objects in memory are being loaded. Rewriting the source code would be highly desirable but could be costly, time-consuming, and would not be an immediate mitigation to this problem. The strcpy function (which is short for String copy) does not work on integers, and it only works on strings. As strcpy does not check for boundary conditions, buffer overflows are certainly possible using this deprecated method.

  -sU

  (正確)

- 

  -sP

- 

  -sN

- 

  -sS

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: In nmap, the -sU flag is used to scan UDP ports. The -sS flag will only scan TCP ports using an SYN scan. The -sP flag is a legacy (and depreciated) command for a ping scan. The -sN flag is used to conduct a TCP NULL scan.

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Maltego is an OSINT tool that is used to gather information from public resources. It has a graphical user interface (GUI) that visualizes the information gathered to help a penetration tester make logical connections between the different data sets collected. Nessus is a popular vulnerability scanner with a module dedicated to reporting that can be helpful during the presentation of your findings in a penetration test. AirCrack-NG is a tool within the Aircrack- ng suite that injects frames to generate traffic while attempting to crack an access point’s WPA-PSK keys. Empire is a command and control framework focused on PowerShell and contains many post-exploitation tools.

  Aircrack-NG

- 

  Shodan

  (正確)

- 

  OpenVAS

- 

  Social Engineer Toolkit (SET)

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.3: Shodan (shodan.io) is a search engine that identifies Internet-connected devices of all types. The engine uses banner grabbing to identify the type of device, firmware/OS/app type, and version, plus vendor and ID information. This involves no direct interaction with the company's public-facing internet assets since this might give rise to detection. This is also the first place an adversary might use to conduct reconnaissance on your company's network. OpenVas, SET, and Aircrak-NG are not considered OSINT tools. OpenVas is a vulnerability scanner. SET is a social engineering tool. Aircrack-NG is a wireless hacking tool.

- 

  Spoofing

- 

  Zero-day

- 

  Spear phishing

- 

  Phishing

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: This is an example of a phishing campaign. Phishing refers to obtaining user authentication or financial information through a fraudulent request for information. Phishing is specifically associated with emailing users with a link to a faked site (or some other malware that steals the information they use to try to authenticate). Spear phishing is an email or electronic communications scam targeted towards a specific individual, organization, or business. In this example, the specific user wasn't targeted by their name or by their association with a particular store, company, or website. Spoofing is a type of attack that disguises a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. Spoofing can occur using different methods, such as MAC spoofing, IP spoofing, call spoofing, and others. A zero-day vulnerability is when the vendor is aware of a security flaw, but a patch has not been developed or applied on an affected system. At this point, a malicious actor can craft an attack and take advantage of the zero-day vulnerability.

A company has recently experienced a data breach and has lost nearly 1 GB of personally identifiable information about its customers. You have been assigned as part of the incident response team to identify how the data was leaked from the network. Your team has conducted an extensive investigation, and so far, the only evidence of a large amount of data leaving the network is from the email server. One user has sent numerous large attachments out of the network to their personal email address. Upon closer inspection, those emails only contain pictures of that user’s recent trip to Australia. What is the most likely explanation for how the data left the network?

- 

  The data was encrypted and emailed to their spouse's email account

- 

  The data was hashed and then emailed to their personal email account

- 

  The files were downloaded from home while connected to the corporate VPN

- 

  Steganography was used to hide the leaked data inside the user's photos

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: The most likely explanation is that the user utilized steganography to hide the leaked data inside their trip photos. Steganography is the process of hiding one message inside another. By hiding the customer’s information within the digital photos, the incident response team would not see the data being hidden without knowing to look for it inside the seemingly benign pictures from the trip. The scenario did not mention whether or not the user connected to the corporate VPN from their home, and the company should log all VPN connections, so this is not the correct answer. Additionally, the user could not hash the data and email it to themselves without losing the information since hashes are a one-way algorithm. Therefore, even if the user had the hash value, they still would not have the customers' personal information. Finally, according to the scenario, the user’s email showed no evidence of encrypted files being sent.

Sarah is conducting a penetration test against Dion Training's Windows-based network. This engagement aims to simulate an advanced persistent threat and demonstrate persistence for 30 days without their system administrators identifying the intrusion. Which of the following commands should Sarah use to run a script that beacons back to her computer every 20 minutes?

- 

  (crontab -l ; echo "*/20 * * * * /tmp/beacon")| crontab -

- 

  schtasks /create /tn beacon /tr C:\temp\beacon.bat /sc MINUTE /mo 20 /ru SYSTEM

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: A scheduled task or scheduled job is an instance of execution, like initiating a process or running a script, that the system performs on a set schedule. Once the task executes, it can prompt the user for interaction or run silently in the background; it all depends on what the task is set up to do. Scheduled tasks in Windows use the schtasks command. The correct answer for this persistence is to enter the command "schtasks /create /tn beacon /tr C:\temp\beacon.bat /sc MINUTE /mo 20 /ru SYSTEM" that will create a task called "beacon" that runs the script at "C:\temp\beacon.bat every 20 minutes as the SYSTEM level user. The other variant of schtasks is incorrect because it used a Linux-based file directory structure to reference the script location and would fail to run in Windows. The crontab options are used in Linux, not in Windows.

  Conducting a Denial of Service attack on 192.168.1.142

- 

  Conducting a brute force login attempt of a remote service on 192.168.1.142

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: The penetration tester is attempting to conduct a brute force login attempt of a remote service on 192.168.1.142, as shown by the multiple login attempts with common usernames and passwords. A brute force attack attempts to crack a password or username or find a hidden web page, or find the key used to encrypt a message, using a trial and error approach and hoping, eventually, to guess correctly. Port Scanning is the name for the technique used to identify open ports and services available on a network host. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack occurs when legitimate users cannot access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to a malicious cyber threat actor's actions. A ping sweep is a basic network scanning technique used to determine which range of IP addresses map to live hosts.

  Perform a remote code execution on the NAC controller

- 

  Harvest the user credentials of an employee and use those to connect

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: Network access control (NAC) is used to prevent unhealthy devices from accessing an organization's internal network. To break into a network that uses NAC, you must perform a NAC bypass attack. One popular NAC bypass method is to spoof the MAC or IP address of a printer or VOIP device since they cannot natively participate in NAC and are often allow listed by administrators. Another method is to configure your attacking device to use IPv6 instead of IPv4. Most routers and switches support IPv4 and IPv6, but many system administrators only configure NAC for their IPv4 devices out of habit. The final method would be to set up a rogue wireless access point to create an on-path condition. This would allow an authorized device to connect to your wireless access point and then use its authorized status to connect to the network.

Which of the following is the BEST way to regularly prevent different security threats from occurring within your network?

- 

  Business continuity training

- 

  Disaster recovery planning

- 

  Penetration testing

- 

  User training and awareness

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: An enterprise network's end users are the most vulnerable attack vector. Studies have shown that an investment in end-user cybersecurity awareness training has the best return on investment of any risk mitigation strategy. While a penetration test might detect various threats and vulnerabilities in your network, it does not prevent them from occurring. Disaster recovery planning creates a disaster recovery plan, which is a documented, structured approach that describes how an organization can quickly resume work after an unplanned incident. Business continuity training will teach employees what to do in the case of a business continuity plan execution. A business continuity plan defines how an organization will continue the delivery of products or services at pre-defined acceptable levels following a disruptive incident. Only end-user awareness training mitigates the biggest network vulnerability we have: our users.

Dion Consulting Group has recently been awarded a contract to provide cybersecurity services for a major hospital chain in 48 cities across the United States. You are conducting a vulnerability scan of the hospital's enterprise network when you detect several devices that could be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. Upon further investigation, you determine that these devices are PLCs used to control the hospital's elevators. Unfortunately, there is not an update available from the elevator manufacturer for these devices. Which of the following mitigations do you recommend?

- 

  Conduct a penetration test of the elevator control system to prove that the possibility of this kind of attack exists

- 

  Recommend immediate disconnection of the elevator's control system from the enterprise network

- 

  Recommend isolation of the elevator control system from the rest of the production network through the change control process

  (正確)

- 

  Recommend immediate replacement of the PLCs with ones that are not vulnerable to this type of attack

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: The best recommendation is to conduct the elevator control system's logical or physical isolation from the rest of the production network and the internet. This should be done through the change control process that brings the appropriate stakeholders together to discuss the best way to mitigate the vulnerability to the elevator control system that defines the business impact and risk of the decision. Sudden disconnection of the PLCs from the rest of the network might have disastrous results (i.e., sick and injured trapped in an elevator) if there were resources that the PLCs were dependent on in the rest of the network. Replacement of the elevators may be prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and likely something that the hospital would not be able to justify to mitigate this vulnerability. Attempting further exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability might inadvertently trap somebody in an elevator or cause damage to the elevators themselves.

  (正確)

- 

  Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)

- 

  OWASP Testing Guide (OTG)

- 

  Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF)

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) was developed by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM) and it outlines every area of an organization that needs testing and how to conduct the relevant tests. The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) was developed by business professionals as a best practice guide for conducting penetration testing. The PTES contains seven main sections that are used to provide a comprehensive overview of the proper structure of a complete penetration test. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an organization aimed at increasing awareness of web security and provides a framework for testing during each phase of the software development process. The OWASP Testing Guide (OTG) provides different steps for the testing process and outlines the importance of assessing the entire organization, including the people, processes, and technology, during a penetration test. The Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) is an open-source resource available to cybersecurity professionals. The ISSAF is comprised of documents that relate to penetration testing, such as guidelines on business continuity and disaster recovery along with legal and regulatory compliance.

You are reverse engineering a malware sample using the Strings tool when you notice the code inside appears to be obfuscated. You look at the following line of output on your screen: 

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_04-57-38-16baaf3607211b50ead805552bb02bdf.png)

Based on the output above, which of the following methods do you believe the attacker used to prevent their malicious code from being easily read or analyzed?

- 

  SQL

- 

  Base64

  (正確)

- 

  XML

- 

  QR coding

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.1: While there are many different formats used by attackers to obfuscate their malicious code, Base64 is by far the most popular. If you see a string like the one above, you can decode it using an online Base64 decoder. I recommend you copy the string above and decode it to see how easy it is to reverse a standard Base64 encoded message. Some more advanced attackers will also use XOR and a key shift in combination with Base64 to encode the message and make it harder to decode, but using a tool like CyberChef can help you decode those. Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to communicate with a database. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a human-readable and machine-readable format. SQL and XML are not considered obfuscation techniques. A QR Code is a two-dimensional version of the barcode, known from product packaging in the supermarket. QR coding is the process of converting some data into a single QR code. QR coding might be considered a form of obfuscation, but it is not shown in this question's example output.

An outside organization has completed a penetration test for a company. One of the report items states that an attacker may have the ability to read TLS traffic from the webserver due to a software bug. What is the MOST likely mitigation for this reported item?

- 

  Ensure patches are deployed

  (正確)

- 

  Implement a VPN for employees

- 

  Install an IDS on the network

- 

  Configure the firewall to block traffic on port 443

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: A patch is designed to correct a known bug or fix a known vulnerability. Since the server is allowing an attacker to read TLS traffic, which should be encrypted and unreadable, this is a software bug in the webserver's code that must be fixed using a patch. An intrusion detection system is a device or software application that monitors and reports on any malicious activity or policy violations on a network or system. An IDS would not mitigate or stop the attacker from reading the TLS traffic, it would only report that it is occurring. A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules to establish a barrier between a trusted and untrusted network. If you configured the firewall to block traffic on port 443 (HTTPS/SSL/TLS), it would block all of the webserver's legitimate users, as well. A virtual private network extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. A VPN would not stop an attacker from being able to read the TLS traffic from the webserver.

You are analyzing the SIEM for your company's e-commerce server when you notice the following URL in the logs of your SIEM:

Based on this line, what type of attack do you expect has been attempted?

- 

  Buffer overflow

- 

  XML injection

  (正確)

- 

  Session hijacking

- 

  SQL injection

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: This is an example of an XML injection. XML injection manipulates or compromises the logic of an XML application or service. The injection of unintended XML content and/or structures into an XML message can alter an application's intended logic. XML Injection can cause the insertion of malicious content into resulting messages/documents. In this case, the URL is attempting to modify the server's XML structure. The original XML structure would be: <addToCart> <item id="5" perItemPrice="50.00" quantity="1" /> </addToCart>. By using the URL above, this would be modified to the following: <addToCart> <item id="5" perItemPrice="0.00" quantity="10" /> <item id="5" perItemPrice="50.00" quantity="0" /> </addToCart>. The result would be that a new line was added in the XML document that could be processed by the server. This line would allow 10 of the product at $0.00 to be added to the shopping cart, while 0 of the product at $50.00 is added to the cart. This defeats the integrity of the e-commerce store's add to cart functionality through this XML injection. A SQL injection occurs when data input by a user is interpreted as a SQL command rather than as normal data by the backend database. A buffer overflow is an exploit that attempts to write data to a buffer and exceed that buffer's boundary to overwrite an adjacent memory location. A session hijacking attack consists of exploiting the web session control mechanism, normally managed for a session token. The real key to answering this question is identifying the XML structured code being entered as part of the URL, shown by the bracketed data.

You have been asked to scan your company’s website using the OWASP ZAP tool. When you perform the scan, you received the following warning:

"The AUTOCOMPLETE output is not disabled in HTML FORM/INPUT containing password type input. Passwords may be stored in browsers and retrieved."

You begin to investigate further by reviewing a portion of the HTML code from the website that is listed below:

Based on your analysis, which of the following actions should you take?

- 

  You recommend that the system administrator pushes out a GPO update to reconfigure the web browsers security settings

- 

  This is a false positive and you should implement a scanner exception to ensure you don’t receive this again during your next scan

- 

  You recommend that the system administrator disables SSL on the server and implements TLS instead

- 

  You tell the developer to review their code and implement a bug/code fix

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: Since your company owns the website, you can require the developer to implement a bug/code fix to prevent the form from allowing the AUTOCOMPLETE function to work on this website. The code change to perform is quite simple, simply adding "autocomplete=off" to the code's first line. The resulting code would be <form action="authenticate.php” autocomplete="off">.

OBJ-2.2: To conduct a banner grab using telnet, you first must connect to the server using “telnet webserver 80”. Once the connection establishes, you will receive a blank prompt, and you then issue the command “HEAD / HTTP/1.1”. It requests the document header from the server and provides information such as the server software version and the server’s operating system.

You have been asked to write a new security policy to reduce the risk of employees working together to steal information from the Dion Training corporate network. Which of the following policies should you create to counter this threat?

- 

  Mandatory vacation policy

  (正確)

- 

  Acceptable use policy

- 

  Privacy policy

- 

  Least privilege policy

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: A mandatory vacation policy requires that all users take time away from work to enjoy a break from their day to day routine of their jobs. But, there is a major side benefit to mandatory vacations regarding your company's security posture. It will require the company to have another employee fill in for the vacationing employee's normal roles and responsibilities by requiring mandatory vacations. The employee who is filling in might come across fraud, abuse, or theft that the vacationing employee is a part of. The concept of least privilege may not stop this theft from occurring since two employees could work together to steal information that they have access to as part of their job. Also, acceptable use outlines the types of activities allowed and not allowed; it won't prevent theft from occurring. A privacy policy discusses how information should be properly stored and secured, but this won't stop an employee from stealing information or detecting the stolen information.

  Train

  (正確)

- 

  moc.

- 

  oc.g

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: When evaluating the code s[-12:-7], you would receive "Train" in response. Within Python, characters in a string can be accessed by their index location. If the string (s) is "DionTraining.com", then each letter from left to right is referenced as s[0] to s[15]. If you want to reference it from right to left, you simply use a negative number, such as s[-12:-7]. The format for the array is [start:end:increment], so s[-12:-7] is evaluated as starting with the 12th position from the right (T in DionTraining.com), count until it reaches the 7th position from the right, incrementing by the default value of 1 each time. This would display, from the end of the word, the 12th position (T), 11th position (r), 10th position (a), 9th position (i), and 8th position (n), and then stop. Note that when counting positions from the right, you begin counting at 1. When counting from the left, you start with position 0 and work up from there.

The local electric power plant contains both business networks and ICS/SCADA networks to control their equipment. Which technology should the power plant’s security administrators look to implement first as part of configuring better defenses for the ICS/SCADA systems?

- 

  Anti-virus software

- 

  Log consolidation

- 

  Automated patch deployment

- 

  Intrusion prevention system

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Since this question is focused on the ICS/SCADA network, the best solution would be implementing an Intrusion Prevention System. ICS/SCADA machines utilize very specific commands to control the equipment and to prevent malicious activity. You could set up strict IPS rules to prevent unknown types of actions from being allowed to occur. Log consolidation is a good idea, but it won't prevent an issue and therefore isn't the most critical thing to add first. Automated patch management should not be conducted, as ICS/SCADA systems must be tested before conducting any patches. Often, patches will break ICS/SCADA functionality. Anti-virus software may or may not be able to run on the equipment, as well, since some ICS/SCADA systems often do not rely on standard operating systems like Windows.

  Social engineering

- 

  API requests and responses

- 

  Reviewing public repositories

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: Passive reconnaissance focuses on collecting information that is widely and openly available from publicly available sources. While network traffic sniffing is considered passive, gaining access to the network to place a sniffer in a good network tap location would not be considered passive. Of the choices provided, publicly accessible sources are the best answer to choose. Collecting API requests and responses would involve a penetration tester sending data to a given server and analyzing the responses received, which is considered an active reconnaissance method. Social engineering is also an active reconnaissance technique that uses deception to trick a user into providing information to an attacker or penetration tester.

  Unquoted service path vulnerability

- 

  Sticky bit vulnerability

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: This penetration tester is attempting to exploit an unsecured SUDO vulnerability. First, they ran the find command and specified that it should look for permissions that follow the numerical representation of the SUID bit permission (+4000). It also looked for any files owned by the root user and were considered regular files (f), then it displays them to the screen. There were 4 files found in this example, one of which was the /usr/bin/sudo file. Next, the penetration tester attempted to perform a chmod against the /usr/bin/sudo file and set its permissions to 4111. If they were successful, this would change the permissions to allow the user, the group, and everyone else on this computer to execute the sudo command. When the sudo command is run, because it has the SUID bit set, the user can run the command as the root user. For this reason, the /usr/bin/sudo should have its permissions set to 4411 and not 4111.

You are conducting a physical penetration test against an organization. You followed an employee to the coffee shop next door, and while they were ordering, you got within 1 foot of them to electronically capture their proximity badge. Which of the following exploits are you planning to use?

- 

  RFID cloning

  (正確)

- 

  Session hijacking

- 

  Credential harvesting

- 

  Bluesnarfing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a standard for identifying and keeping track of an object's physical location through the use of radio waves. RFID cloning is the act of copying authentication data from an RFID badge's microchip to another badge. In an attack scenario, badge cloning is useful because it enables the attacker to obtain authorization credentials without actually stealing a physical badge from the organization. Badge cloning can be done through handheld RFID writers, which are inexpensive and easy to use. You simply hold the badge up to the RFID writer device, press a button to copy its tag's data, then hold a blank badge up to the device and write the copied data. RFID cloning tools can read the data like any normal RFID reader would and be located up to several feet away or inside a bag. Bluesnarfing is a technical attack that steals information from a user’s device by reading the data using Bluetooth. Bluesnarfing is used to steal sensitive data like contacts, calendars, emails, and text messages. Session hijacking is a type of spoofing attack where the attacker disconnects a host then replaces it with his or her machine, spoofing the original host’s IP address. Credential harvesting is an attack designed to steal usernames and passwords.

Which of the following network devices can accidentally misdirect probes or attacks if the penetration tester is not aware of their existence?

- 

  Load balancer

  (正確)

- 

  Wireless access point

- 

  Network sniffer

- 

  Intrusion detection system

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.2: A load balancer is used to ensure network hosts receive a response to a request in a timely manner by redirecting requests across several servers. Due to this, load balancers may inadvertently misdirect probes or attacks to a different server than the penetration tester initially targeted. Wireless access points, intrusion detection systems, and network sniffers are passive devices and do not redirect inbound traffic from a penetration tester.

You are analyzing the logs of a web server. Consider the following log sample: 

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_04-54-48-ff7aea00905ca103a89e0be89948e527.png)

Based on the logs above, which of the following type of attacks was conducted against this server?

- 

  SQL injection

  (正確)

- 

  Directory traversal

- 

  XML injection

- 

  Cross-site scripting

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: SQL injection is a code injection technique that is used to attack data-driven applications. SQL injections are conducted by inserting malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution. For example, an attacker may try to dump the contents of the database by using this technique. A common SQL injection technique is to insert an always true statement, such as 1 == 1, or in this example, 6810 = = 6810. In this case, the SQL injection is evidenced by the SQL statements being sent to the web application hosted by WordPress. XML Injection is an attack technique used to manipulate or compromise an XML application or service's logic. The injection of unintended XML content and/or structures into an XML message can alter the application's intended logic. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in a browser side script, to a different end-user. A directory traversal attack aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the webroot folder. By manipulating variables or URLs that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system, including application source code or configuration and critical system files.

Which of the following is the most difficult to confirm with an external vulnerability scan?

- 

  Blind SQL injection

  (正確)

- 

  Cross-site scripting (XSS)

- 

  Unpatched web server

- 

  Cross-site request forgery (XSRF/CSRF)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: Vulnerability scanners typically cannot confirm that a blind SQL injection with the execution of code has previously occurred. XSS and CSRF/XSRF are typically easier to detect because the scanner can pick up information that proves a successful attack. The banner information can usually identify unpatched servers.

A company wants to ensure that its mobile devices are configured to protect any data stored on them if they are lost or stolen. Which of the following should you enable and enforce through their MDM?

- 

  Full storage encryption

  (正確)

- 

  Enable SSO

- 

  Remove backups

- 

  Enable OS updates

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Mobile device management (MDM) software suites are designed to manage the use of smartphones and tablets within an enterprise. Full storage encryption is used to encrypt the user and system data stored in the device’s internal storage. The encryption key is stored in a protected portion of the device and can be used to remotely wipe the device if it is lost or stolen. Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication technology that allows a user to authenticate once and receive authorizations for multiple services. Operating system updates are made freely available by the software manufacturer to fix problems in a particular software version, including any security vulnerabilities. Updates can be classified as hotfixes (available only to selected customers and for a limited problem), patches (generally available), and service packs (installable collections of patches and software improvements). A backup is a copy of user and system data that can enable the recovery of data after data loss or a disaster.

You call up the CFO's assistant at an organization that is the target of your penetration test. You tell the assistant that you are an IRS agent and will be coming by this afternoon to meet with their boss. You ask the assistant for their email address so you can send them a PowerPoint to print out for the CFO to review before the meeting. When the assistant opens the PowerPoint, a warning pops up asking to enable Macros. You tell them to click accept and hurry because the CFO must get a copy of this before you arrive in 30 minutes. What type of social engineering principle are you using to exploit this organization?

- 

  Social proof

- 

  Trust

- 

  Scarcity

- 

  Authority

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Authority is used to take advantage of people's willingness to act when directed to by someone with the power or right to give orders. For example, an attacker may pose as a police officer, government agent, or high-level executive to force an employee to take some form of action, whether it is ethically dubious or counter to their interests. Scarcity is used to create a fear in a person of missing out on a special deal or offer. This technique is used in advertising all the time, such as "supplies are limited," "only available for the next 4 hours", and other such artificial limitations being used. Social proof relies on the fact that people want to fit in and conform. If a victim sees or believes others are performing some action, they will believe it is okay for them to do it.

You are developing your vulnerability scanning plan and attempting to scope your scans properly. You have decided to focus on the criticality of a system to the organization's operations when prioritizing the system in the scope of your scans. Which of the following would be the best place to gather the criticality of a system?

- 

  Review the asset inventory and BCP

  (正確)

- 

  Conduct a nmap scan of the network to determine the OS of each system

- 

  Ask the CEO for a list of the critical systems

- 

  Scope the scan based on IP subnets

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: To best understand a system's criticality, you should review the asset inventory and the BCP. Most organizations classify each asset in its inventory based on its criticality to the organization's operations. This helps to determine how many spare parts to have, the warranty requirements, service agreements, and other key factors to help keep these assets online and running at all times. Additionally, you can review the business continuity plan (BCP) since this will provide the organization's plan for continuing business operations in the event of a disaster or other outage. Generally, the systems or operations listed in a BCP are the most critical ones to support business operations. While the CEO may be able to provide a list of the most critical systems in a large organization, it isn't easy to get them to take the time to do it, even if they did know the answer. Worse, in most large organizations, the CEO isn't going to know what systems he relies on, but instead just the business functions they serve, again making this a bad choice. While conducting a nmap scan may help you determine what OS is being run on each system, this information doesn't help you determine criticality to operations. The same is true of using IP subnets since a list of subnets by itself doesn't provide criticality or prioritization of the assets.

A cybersecurity analyst is attempting to perform an active reconnaissance technique to audit their company’s security controls. Which DNS assessment technique would be classified as active?

- 

  A DNS forward or reverse lookup

- 

  A whois query

- 

  A zone transfer

  (正確)

- 

  Using maltego

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: DNS zone transfer, also sometimes known by the inducing DNS query type AXFR, is a DNS transaction type. It is one of the many mechanisms available for administrators to replicate DNS databases across a set of DNS servers. DNS zone transfers are an active technique. Performing a whois query is a passive reconnaissance technique that performs a query of the databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of other information. Performing DNS forward and reverse lookups is an active technique that allows the resolution of names to IP addresses and IP addresses to names. This can be conducted as a passive technique. Maltego is used for open-source intelligence and forensics. It focuses on providing a library for data discovery from open sources and visualizing that information in a graph format suitable for link analysis and data mining. It collects this information passively since it can acquire the information from whois lookup servers, a DNS lookup tool using public DNS servers, or even emails and hostnames one can acquire from theHarvester.

Your company has installed a guest wireless network in the break room. According to company policy, employees may only connect to the network and use it during their lunch break. Which of the following policies should you have each employee sign to show they understand and accept the use conditions for this guest network?

- 

  SLA

- 

  NDA

- 

  AUP

  (正確)

- 

  MOU

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: An acceptable use policy (AUP), acceptable usage policy, or fair use policy is a set of rules applied by the owner, creator, or administrator of a network, website, or service, that restrict how the network, website, or system may be used and sets guidelines as to how it should be used. In this scenario, this is the most appropriate policy to utilize. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is important because it defines the responsibilities of each party in an agreement, provides the scope and authority of the agreement, clarifies terms, and outlines compliance issues. A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a legal contract or part of a contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to. A service level agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a service provider and a client for particular aspects of the service, such as quality, availability, or responsibilities.

Based on the output above, which of the following ports listed as open represents the most significant security vulnerability to your network?

- 

  53

- 

  443

- 

  22

- 

  23

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: Port 23 is used by telnet and is not considered secure because it sends all of its data in cleartext, including authentication data like usernames and passwords. As an analyst, you should recommend that telnet be disabled and blocked from use. The other open ports are SSH (port 22), DNS (port 53), and HTTPS (port 443).

A penetration tester is emulating an insider threat during an engagement. The penetration tester was given access to a regular user account and a basic Windows 10 client on the network. The penetration tester did not receive any network diagrams, maps, or target IP address. Their goal is to identify any possible Windows domain controllers on the intranet.diontaining.com domain. Which of the following commands should they use from the command prompt to achieve their goal?

- 

  nslookup -type=any _ntlm._tcp.intranet.diontraining.com

- 

  nslookup -type=any _kerberos._tcp.intranet.diontraining.com

  (正確)

- 

  nslookup -type=any _ldap._tcp.intranet.diontraining.com

  (正確)

- 

  nslookup -type=any _lanman._tcp.intranet.diontraining.com

- 

  nslookup -type=any _smtp._tcp.intranet.diontraining.com

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.3: There are several methods for locating Domain Controllers, depending on what you know about the environment you are using. If you are using a Windows client, you can use the nslookup command. You need to specify which protocol you are searching for in the name. Since we are trying to identify domain controllers, we need to look for Kerberos and LDAP-based protocols on the intranet.diontraining.com domain. If you were using a Linux client, you could run a similar command syntax using dig.

What type of attack was most likely being attempted by the attacker?

- 

  Impersonation

- 

  Password spraying

  (正確)

- 

  Session hijacking

- 

  Credential stuffing

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: Password spraying refers to the attack method that takes many usernames and loops them with a single password. We can use multiple iterations using many different passwords, but the number of passwords attempted is usually low compared to the number of users attempted. This method avoids password lockouts, and it is often more effective at uncovering weak passwords than targeting specific users. In the scenario provided, only one or two attempts are being made to each username listed. This is indicative of a password spraying attack instead of a brute force attempt against a single user. Impersonation is the act of pretending to be another person for fraud. Credential stuffing is the automated injection of breached username/password pairs to gain user accounts access fraudulently. This is a subset of the brute force attack category: large numbers of spilled credentials are automatically entered into websites until they are potentially matched to an existing account. The attacker can then hijack the account for their purposes. Session hijacking exploits a valid computer session to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system.

Your organization has been receiving many phishing emails recently, and you are trying to determine why they are effective in getting your users to click on their links. The latest email consists of what looks like an advertisement that is offering an exclusive early access opportunity to buy a new iPhone at a discounted price. Still, there are only 5 phones available at this price. What type of social engineering principle is being exploited here?

- 

  Scarcity

  (正確)

- 

  Trust

- 

  Familiarity

- 

  Intimidation

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.6: Scarcity is used to create a fear in a person of missing out on a special deal or offer. This technique is used in advertising all the time, such as "supplies are limited," "only available for the next 4 hours", and other such artificial limitations being used. Familiarity is a social engineering technique that relies on assuming a widely known organization's persona. For example, in the United States, nearly 25% of Americans have a Bank of America account. For this reason, phishing campaigns often include emails pretending to be from Bank of America since 1 in 4 people who receive the email in the United States are likely to have an account. This makes them familiar with the bank name and is more likely to click on the email link.

Fail To Pass Systems has just been the victim of another embarrassing data breach. Their database administrator needed to work from home this weekend, so he downloaded the corporate database to his work laptop. On his way home, he left the laptop in an Uber, and a few days later, the data was posted on the internet. Which of the following mitigations would have provided the greatest protection against this data breach?

- 

  Require data at rest encryption on all endpoints

  (正確)

- 

  Require a VPN to be utilized for all telework employees

- 

  Require all new employees to sign an NDA

- 

  Require data masking for any information stored in the database

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: The greatest protection against this data breach would have been to require data at rest encryption on all endpoints, including this laptop. If the laptop were encrypted, the data would not have been readable by others, even if it was lost or stolen. While requiring a VPN for all telework employees is a good idea, it would not have prevented this data breach since the laptop's loss caused it. Even if a VPN had been used, the same data breach would have still occurred if the employee copied the database to the machine. Remember on exam day that many options are good security practices, but you must select the option that solves the issue or problem in the question being asked. Similarly, data masking and NDAs are useful techniques, but they would not have solved this particular data breach.

You are analyzing a Python script that isn't functioning properly. You suspect the issue is with the string manipulation being used in the code. Review the following Python code snippet: 

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_04-58-49-73538141b54b3b3c1edd0db53363819b.png)

Based on your analysis, what should be displayed on the screen by the print command?

- 

  Train

  (正確)

- 

  oc.g

- 

  nTrai

- 

  moc.

#### 解釋

OBJ-5.2: When evaluating the code s[4:9], you would receive "Train" in response. Within Python, characters in a string can be accessed by their index location. If the string (s) is "DionTraining.com", then each letter from left to right is referenced as s[0] to s[15]. For example, if you enter s[5], you would receive the letter "r" in response. The format for the array is [start:end:increment], so s[4:9] is evaluated as starting with the 4th position (T in DionTraining.com since computers start counting at 0) and continuing to display letters until it reaches the 9th position (the second letter i in Training). This is because it treats ranges as the start value and the value to stop when it reaches it, similar to a for loop. If we wanted that "I" to be displayed as well, we would need to stop at 10 instead of 9. Since there is no increment provided in this argument, it uses the default of 1 position at a time, moving from left to right as it counts upward through the string.

Your company wants to increase the security of its server room. Which TWO of the following should they install to protect the server room's contents?

- 

  Biometric lock

  (正確)

- 

  Bollard

- 

  Privacy window shades

- 

  Strong passwords

- 

  Cable lock

- 

  Badge reader

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: A badge reader and biometric lock can be used on a server room door to provide multifactor authentication. Biometrics are identifying features stored as digital data that can be used to authenticate a user. Typical features used include facial pattern, iris, retina, or fingerprint pattern, and signature recognition. This requires a relevant scanning device, such as a fingerprint reader, and a database of biometric information for authentication to occur. A badge reader can be used to read a security badge using RFID, a smart card, or a barcode to authenticate a user. Cable locks are used for laptops, not servers or server rooms. A bollard is used in the parking lot or the front of a building. Strong passwords are used for the servers, not the server room itself. Privacy windows shades could be used, but they are not as strong of a defense as a badge reader and biometric keypad on the door to the server room.

Alex is conducting a penetration test of Dion Training's network. They just successfully exploited a host on the network. Which of the following command should Alex utilize to establish persistence on the machine by creating a bind shell using netcat?

- 

  nc -p 52154 /bin/sh

- 

  nc -lp 52154 -e /bin/sh

  (正確)

- 

  nc -p 52154 -e /bin/sh

- 

  nc -lvp 52154 /bin/sh

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: A bind shell is a shell that binds to a specific port on the target host to listen for incoming connections. This is often created using Netcat. Netcat (nc) is an open-source networking utility for debugging and investigating the network, and that can be used to create TCP/UDP connections and investigate them. It is extremely popular with penetration testers and attackers alike due to its multiple use cases. You should be familiar with setting up a listener and establishing a connection to the listener using netcat. Using the -lp option sets up a listener on the machine using the port specified (52154 in this scenario). To start the connection to the listener, you would enter "nc <IPADDR> <PORT> -e <SHELL>", substituting the details for each parameter in each set of brackets.

  Forensic analysis report

- 

  Trends analysis report

- 

  Chain of custody report

- 

  Lessons learned report

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.4: The lessons learned report provides you with the details of the incident, its severity, the remediation method, and, most importantly, how effective your response was. Additionally, it provides recommendations for improvements in the future. A forensic analysis report would not provide recommendations for future improvements, even though it provides many of the other details. A trend analysis report describes whether behaviors have increased, decreased, or stayed the same over time. The chain of custody report is the chronological documentation or paper trail that records the custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of physical or electronic evidence.

What type of vulnerability does this website have?

- 

  Weak or default configurations

- 

  Race condition

- 

  Improper error handling

- 

  Insecure direct object reference

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a cybersecurity issue that occurs when a web application developer uses an identifier for direct access to an internal implementation object but provides no additional access control and/or authorization checks. An attacker could change the userid number and directly access any user's profile page in this scenario. A race condition is a software vulnerability when the resulting outcome from execution processes is directly dependent on the order and timing of certain events. Those events fail to execute in the order and timing intended by the developer. Weak or default configurations are commonly a result of incomplete or ad-hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, unnecessary HTTP methods, permissive Cross-Origin resource sharing (CORS), and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. Improper handling of errors can reveal implementation details that should never be revealed, such as detailed information that can provide hackers important clues on the system's potential flaws.

During the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test, you have determined that your client's employees all use iPhones that connect back to the corporate network over a secure VPN connection. Which of the following methods would MOST likely be the best method for exploiting these?

- 

  Use web-based exploits against the devices web interfaces

- 

  Use a tool like ICSSPLOIT to target specific vulnerabilities

- 

  Use social engineering to trick a user into opening a malicious APK

- 

  Identify a jailbroken device for easy exploitation

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: When targeting mobile devices, you must first determine if the company uses iPhones or Android-based devices. If they are using an iPhone, it becomes much more difficult to attack since iPhone users can only install trusted apps from the App Store. If the user has jailbroken their phone, they can sideload apps and other malware. After identifying a jailbroken device, you can use social engineering to trick the user into installing your malicious code and then take control of their device.

You are a penetration tester hired by an organization that wants you to conduct a risk assessment of their perimeter network. The company-provided of Engagement states that you must do all penetration testing from an external IP address without any prior knowledge of the internal IT system architecture. What kind of penetration test will you perform?

- 

  Unknown environment testing

  (正確)

- 

  Partially known environment testing

- 

  Semi-trusted environment testing

- 

  Known environment testing

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: An unknown environment penetration test requires no previous information and usually takes the approach of an uninformed attacker. The penetration tester has no prior information about the target system or network in an unknown environment penetration test. These tests provide a realistic scenario for testing the defenses, but they can be costlier and more time-consuming to conduct as the tester is examining a system from an outsider’s perspective. A partially known environment tester has the user’s access and knowledge levels, potentially with elevated privileges on a system. These partially known environment penetration testers typically have some knowledge of a network’s internals, potentially including design and architecture documentation and an account internal to the network. A known environment test is known by several different names, including clear-box, open-box, auxiliary, or logic-driven testing. It falls on the opposite end of the spectrum from an unknown environment test because the penetration testers have full access to source code, architecture documentation, and so forth. A known environment penetration tester can also perform static code analysis, so familiarity with source code analyzers, debuggers, and similar tools are necessary for this type of testing. A semi-trusted environment test is made up term and is used as a distractor in this question.

Based on the output above, which of the following exploits are you preparing to use?

- 

  SMB exploit

- 

  FTP exploit

- 

  SNMP exploit

  (正確)

  SMTP exploit

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: SNMP provides a lot of information about different target devices on the network. Based on the output shown, you should identify that this is an SNMP scan based on the "community string" keyword. From your Network+ and Security+ studies, you should remember that SNMP uses community strings as a basic authentication mechanism before allowing you to access a network device's statistics. In this scan, two devices are found on this network with default public and private community strings. This makes these devices vulnerable to an SNMP attack for further exploitation.

  Local file inclusion

- 

  SQL injection

  (正確)

- 

  Cookie manipulation

- 

  Session hijacking

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: The most common type of code injection is SQL injection. An SQL injection attempts to modify one or more of an SQL query's four basic functions: select, insert, delete, or update. Two common methods of performing an SQL injection are either using a single apostrophe (') or submitting an always true statement like 1=1. In the scan results, you can see that a statement of "1 OR 17 - 7 = 10" was used. Notice that %20 is the ASCII encoded equivalent of the space character. As a penetration tester, you need to be familiar with common ASCII encoded text used in URLs equivalents like %20 (space), %5c (\), and %2F (/) to identify SQL injections and file inclusions.

While conducting a penetration test of a web application, you enter the following URL, http://test.diontraining.com/index.php?id=1%20OR%2017-7%3d10. What type of exploit are you attempting?

- 

  SQL injection

  (正確)

- 

  Session hijacking

- 

  XML injection

- 

  Buffer overflow

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: This is an example of a Boolean-based SQL injection. This occurs when data input by a user is interpreted as a SQL command rather than as normal data by the backend database. In this example, notice that the statement being parsed as part of the URL after the equal sign is equivalent to 1 or 17-7=10. This means the portion of the statement that is 17-7=10 would return a value of 1 (since it is true). Then, we are left to compute if 1 = 1, and since it does, the SQL database will treat this as a positive authentication. This is simply an obfuscation technique of a 1=1 SQL injection technique. A buffer overflow is an exploit that attempts to write data to a buffer and exceed that buffer's boundary to overwrite an adjacent memory location. A session hijacking attack consists of exploiting the web session control mechanism, normally managed for a session token. XML Injection is an attack technique used to manipulate or compromise an XML application or service's logic.

Dion Training conducts weekly vulnerability scanning of their network and patches any identified issues within 24 hours. Which of the following best describes the company's risk response strategy?

- 

  Transference

- 

  Mitigation

  (正確)

- 

  Acceptance

- 

  Avoidance

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: Risk mitigation is the overall process of reducing exposure to or the effects of risk factors, such as patching a vulnerable system. Transference (or sharing) means assigning risk to a third party (such as an insurance company or a contract with a supplier that defines liabilities). Avoidance means that the company stops doing an activity that is risk-bearing. Acceptance means that no countermeasures are put in place either because the level of risk does not justify the cost or because there will be an unavoidable delay before the countermeasures are deployed.

You are attending a cybersecurity conference and just watched a security researcher demonstrating the exploitation of a web interface on a SCADA/ICS component. This caused the device to malfunction and be destroyed. You recognize that the same component is used throughout your company’s manufacturing plants. Which of the following mitigation strategies would provide you with the most immediate protection against this emergent threat?

- 

  Replace the affected SCADA/ICS components with more secure models from a different manufacturer

- 

  Demand that the manufacturer of the component release a patch immediately and deploy the patch as soon as possible

- 

  Evaluate if the web interface must remain open for the system to function; if it isn’t needed, block the web interface

  (正確)

- 

  Logically or physically isolate the SCADA/ICS component from the enterprise network

#### 解釋

OBJ-4.2: The most immediate protection against this emergent threat would be to block the web interface from being accessible over the network. Before doing this, you must evaluate whether the interface needs to remain open for the system to function properly. If it is not needed, you should block it to minimize the SCADA/ICS component's attack surface. Ideally, your SCADA/ICS components should already be logically or physically isolated from the enterprise network. Since the question doesn’t mention the networks as an area of concern, we can assume they are already following the industry best practice of logical or physical segmentation between the SCADA/ICS network and the enterprise network. On the exam, make sure you focus on the question being asked. In this case, the question focuses on the web interface. Developing a patch can be a time-consuming process, therefore waiting for the manufacturer to provide a patch will not provide immediate protection to your components. The same is true for replacing the affected components. Even if you could get the company to authorize the funding for such a purchase, it would take time to order, ship, receive, and install the new components. Additionally, you would cause unwanted downtime in the factory during the installation of the components, making it an ineffective option when simply blocking the web interface is free, quick, and effective.

Dion Training Solutions has just installed a backup generator for their offices that use SCADA/ICS for remote monitoring of the system. The generator’s control system has an embedded cellular modem that periodically connects to the generator’s manufacturer to provide usage statistics. The modem is configured for outbound connections only, and the generator has no data connection with any of Dion Training’s other networks. The manufacturer utilizes data minimization procedures and uses the data to recommend preventative maintenance service and ensure maximum uptime and reliability by identifying parts that need to be replaced. Which of the following cybersecurity risk is being assumed in this scenario?

- 

  There is a medium risk being assumed since the manufacturer could use the data for purposes other than originally agreed upon

- 

  There is a critical risk being assumed since the cellular modem represents a threat to the enterprise network if an attacker exploits the generator and then pivots to the production environment

- 

  There is a minimal risk being assumed since the cellular modem is configured for outbound connections only

  (正確)

- 

  There is a high risk being assumed since the presence of a cellular modem could allow an attacker to remotely disrupt the generator

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.5: There is a minimal risk being assumed in this scenario since the cellular modem is configured for outbound connections only. This also minimizes the risk of an attacker gaining remote access to the generator. The generator is logically and physically isolated from the rest of the enterprise network, so even if an attacker could exploit the generator, they could not pivot into the production network. While there is a risk of the manufacturer using the data for purposes other than originally agreed upon, this is a minimal risk due to the manufacturer’s data minimization procedures and the type of data collected. Should the manufacturer choose to use usage statistics about the generator for some other purpose, it would have a negligible impact on the company since it does not contain any PII or proprietary company data.

  (正確)

- 

  schtasks /create /tn beacon /tr C:\temp\beacon.bat /sc MINUTE /mo 20 /ru SYSTEM

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.7: A scheduled task or scheduled job is an instance of execution, like initiating a process or running a script, that the system performs on a set schedule. Once the task executes, it can prompt the user for interaction or run silently in the background; it all depends on what the task is set up to do. Scheduled tasks in Linux use the crontab command. The correct answer for this persistence is to enter the command "(crontab -l ; echo "*/20 * * * * /tmp/beacon.sh")| crontab -" that will run the script at "/tmp/beacon.sh every 20 minutes as the SYSTEM level user. The other variant of crontab is incorrect because it would run every 20 hours, not 20 minutes. The schtasks options are used in Windows, not in Linux.

- 

  nmap -p80,443 -iL servers.txt -oX results.txt

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.4: The command (nmap -p80,443 -iL servers.txt -oG results.txt) will only perform a Nmap scan against ports 80 and 443. The -iL option will scan each of the listed server's IP addresses. The -oG option will save the results in a greppable format to the file results.txt while still displaying the normal results to the shell. The option of -sL will only list the servers to scan, but it will not scan them. The option of -oX is for outputting the results to a file in an XML format.

  WSDL document

- 

  SDK documentation

- 

  Swagger document

  (正確)

- 

  XSD file

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: A swagger document is the REST API equivalent of a WSDL document that defines a SOAP-based web service. Since Dion Training's voucher fulfillment system uses a REST API, you should request a copy of the swagger document to conduct a more efficient assessment of their web application since this is a known-environment assessment. SDK documentation is used to document the software development kit and is not relevant to the REST API being tested. An XML Schema Definition (XSD) is a recommendation that enables developers to define the structure and data types for XML documents.

You have been hired by a corporate client to perform a web application penetration test. After you presented your findings to the client, they have asked you to perform a static code review, update the web server application, and configure a new web application firewall to protect the system. The client organization does not have additional budget or a written modification to your previously signed contract to support these requests. Which of the following are you experiencing?

- 

  Improper target selection

- 

  Scope creep

  (正確)

- 

  Scheduling issue

- 

  System hardening

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: Scope creep is the condition that occurs when a client requests additional services after a scope of work (SOW) has been signed and the project scope has been documented. In this case, the client is now requesting a lot more work to be performed after the contract was already signed. If the client wants these additional services, a contract modified would be required, and this would likely require additional resources and budget to support it.

  ARP spoofing

  (正確)

- 

  Evil twin

- 

  IP spoofing

- 

  Reflective DNS

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.1: ARP spoofing (also known as ARP poisoning) is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer, server, or gateway on the network. A reflective DNS attack is a two-step attack used in DDoS attacks. The attacker sends a large number of requests to one or more legitimate DNS servers while using a spoofed source IP of the targeted victim. The DNS server then replies to the spoofed IP and unknowingly floods the targeted victim with responses to DNS requests that it never sent. An evil twin is a rogue wireless access point that masquerades as a legitimate Wi-Fi access point so that an attacker can gather personal or corporate information without the user's knowledge. IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets that have a modified source address to either hide the identity of the sender, impersonate another computer system, or both.

  The network diagrams with the SSIDs of the wireless access points used by the client

- 

  The frequencies of the wireless access points and devices used by the client

  (正確)

- 

  The make and model of the wireless access points used by the client

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: To ensure you are not accidentally targeting another organization's wireless infrastructure during your penetration test, you should have the frequencies of the wireless access points and devices used by the client documented in the scoping documents. This would include whether your clients use Wireless A, B, G, N, AC, or AX and if they are using the 2.4 GHz or 5.0 GHz spectrum for their communications. Often, this scoping document will also include the SSID names to ensure the penetration tester is assessing the wireless network owned by the organization and not someone else's by mistake.

  Penetration test

  (正確)

- 

  Patch management

- 

  Asset management

#### 解釋

OBJ-1.2: Penetration tests provide an organization with an external attacker’s perspective on their security status. The NIST process for penetration testing divides tests into four phases: planning, discovery, attack, and reporting. The penetration test results are valuable security planning tools, as they describe the actual vulnerabilities that an attacker might exploit to gain access to a network. A vulnerability scan provides an assessment of your security posture from an internal perspective. Asset management refers to a systematic approach to the governance and realization of value from the things that a group or entity is responsible for over their whole life cycles. It may apply both to tangible assets and intangible assets. Patch management is the process that helps acquire, test, and install multiple patches (code changes) on existing applications and software tools on a computer, enabling systems to stay updated on existing patches and determining which patches are the appropriate ones.

A cybersecurity analyst working at a major university is reviewing the SQL server log of completed transactions and notices the following entry: 

![img](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/quiz_question/2022-01-17_04-53-22-0b8b2364f63360f59b78d402ca081393.png)

Based on this transaction log, which of the following most likely occurred?

- 

  The application and the SQL database are functioning properly

- 

  The SQL server has insufficient logging and monitoring

- 

  A student with ID #1235235 used an SQL injection to give themselves straight A's

- 

  Someone used an SQL injection to assign straight A's to the student with ID #1235235

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: Based on this transaction log entry, it appears that the ID# field was not properly validated before being passed to the SQL server. This would allow someone to conduct an SQL injection and retrieve the student's grades and set all of this student's grades to an 'A' at the same time. It is common to look for a '1==1' type condition to identify an SQL injection. There are other methods to conduct an SQL injection attack that could be utilized by an attacker. If input validation is not being performed on user-entered data, an attacker can exploit any SQL language aspect and inject SQL-specific commands. This entry is suspicious and indicates that either the application or the SQL database is not functioning properly. Still, there appears to be adequate logging and monitoring based on what we can see and whether the question never indicates logging was an issue. An SQL database would not be designed to set ALL of a particular student's grades to A's, thus making this single entry suspicious. Most SQL statements in an SQL log will be fairly uniform and repetitive by nature when you review them. This leaves us with the question as to who person this SQL injection. Per the question choices, it could be the student with ID# 1235235 or "someone." While it seems as if student #1235235 had the most to gain from this, without further investigation, we cannot prove that it actually was student #1235235 that performed the SQL injection. Undoubtedly, student #125235 should be a person of interest in any ensuing investigations, but additional information (i.e., whose credentials were being used, etc.) should be used before making any accusations. Therefore, the answer is that "someone" performed this SQL injection.

Based on this description, what portion of the penetration test is being conducted?

- 

  Vulnerability assessment

- 

  Information reporting

- 

  Active information gathering

- 

  Passive information gathering

  (正確)

#### 解釋

OBJ-2.1: Passive information gathering consists of numerous activities where the penetration tester gathers open-source or publicly available information without the organization under investigation being aware that the information has been accessed. Instead, active information gathering starts to probe the organization using DNS Enumeration, Port Scanning, and OS Fingerprinting techniques. Vulnerability assessments are another form of active information gathering. Information reporting occurs after the penetration test is complete, and it involves writing a final report with the results, vulnerabilities, and lessons learned during the assessment.

Jason is conducting an assessment of a network-enabled software platform that contains a published API. In reviewing the platform's key management, he discovers that API keys are embedded in the application's source code. Which of the following statements best describes the security flaw with this coding practice?

- 

  It is difficult to control the permission levels for embedded keys

- 

  The embedded key may be discovered by an attacker who reverse engineers the source code

  (正確)

- 

  Key management is no longer required since the key is embedded in the source code

- 

  Changing the API key will require a corresponding software upgrade

#### 解釋

OBJ-3.3: A sophisticated adversary may discover the software's embedded key through reverse engineering the source code. This inadvertent key disclosure could then allow an attacker to abuse the API in ways other than intended. Key management would still be required, even if the key is embedded in the source code. Permission levels of a software-embedded key are still controlled like any other key. While the added inconvenience of installing new software on the client side every time the key is changed would be inconvenient, this option does not address the underlying security issues with embedding API keys into the source code.
